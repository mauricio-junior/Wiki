Recently one issue was reported to me where some of the administrators reported that they were unable to use SharePoint designer and while trying to open the sites they were getting the message &quot;The Web server at URL does not appear to have Microsoft SharePoint
 Foundation installed&quot;. <br />

The site was functioning well with all capabilities in browser. I noticed that these all sites were hosted under a specific wen application so it was a clear indication that there was something wrong at web application level.
<br />
<br />
After few initial investigations, I managed to get it resolved. <br />
<br />
Here are the steps followed:<br />
<ol>
<li>Login into the <strong>Central Administration</strong>. </li><li>In the main page click on <strong>Security option</strong> in left hand navigation.
</li><li>In the next page select the <strong>web application</strong> hosting your sites.
</li><li>Click on <strong>default</strong>--&gt; Check the option of enable Client Integration.
</li></ol>
