<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

We have been working onsite to make our corporate portal claims enabled with Siteminder and an XML/API gateway called Vordel.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been successful in getting the Trusted Identify Provider (TIP) to create the user mappings.&nbsp; Long story short, our vendor
 asked us to loop the farm back to classic so that we could test the migration again.&nbsp; So, we refreshed the databases, removed the TIP - and went back to square one.<br />
<br />
However, when we went back to square one - I ran into some problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was simply unable to get the &quot;Claim Provider Identifier&quot; to populate automatically (as it was supported to do -<a title="THANKS STEVE!" href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/speschka/archive/2012/08/08/mapping-user-profiles-for-saml-users-with-an-ad-import-in-sharepoint-2013.aspx" target="_blank">
 reference</a> ).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So, notice below - this is how I *wanted* things to look.&nbsp; I was using &#39;mail&#39; as the SPS-ClaimID and my TIP was called SNI.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

<br />
However, like I indicated - when I rolled back - I was unable to get the &quot;Claim Identify Provider&quot; to show up.&nbsp; I was able to get SPS-ClaimiD as well as (when I added the TIP using the Powershell command) the &quot;Claim Provider Type&quot; = Trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it looks
 like something got STUCK in the database somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I found a trick however.&nbsp; I edited it using the &quot;Forfront Identify Manager&quot; client (&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office Servers\14.0\Synchronization Service\UIShell\miisclient.exe&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, it&#39;s probably the greatest program known to SharePoint UPA administration.&nbsp;
 Know it, learn it, love it.<br />
<br />
Open up FIMs and click on the connection titled &quot;Extensible Connectivity&quot; and select &quot;Properties&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Ok - now navigate to &quot;Configure Attribute Flow.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems to be the guts of the UPA and if something gets hosed up in CA - you can come in here and right every wrong.&nbsp; It&#39;s the place where life magically becomes a little more fair.&nbsp; A happier place.
<br />
<br />
Notice, and I don&#39;t know why - but in the metaverse attribute - I have &quot;SPS_MV_String_SPS-ClaimProviderID&quot; in there.&nbsp; I have no idea how/why/what this means.&nbsp; However, it didn&#39;t match DEV and DEV was working.&nbsp; So, I fixed it.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12309192/2013-04-26%2011_27_51-SNI%20-%20visionapp%20Remote%20Desktop%202012.jpg"><img alt=" " src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12309192/2013-04-26%2011_27_51-SNI%20-%20visionapp%20Remote%20Desktop%202012.jpg" style="border-width:0px;border-style:solid;" /></a><br />
<br />
To make it work - select &quot;SPS-ClaimProviderID&quot; and click &quot;EDIT&quot;.&nbsp; You will notice that the mapping will change in the upper window.&nbsp; Verify that you got this right - and it looks EXACTLY like what I have below.&nbsp;&nbsp; THEN, click OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will then go into &quot;User
 Property Mappings&quot; in CA -&gt; User Profile&nbsp; and see that your TIP is in there.<br />
<br />

<br />
You can do a lot of stuff in here - of course, nobody recommends using this as the first option&nbsp;- but if you&#39;re having some problems getting things to map - this appears to be a pretty good tool to use that has bailed me out a few times.&nbsp; YMMV.<br />
