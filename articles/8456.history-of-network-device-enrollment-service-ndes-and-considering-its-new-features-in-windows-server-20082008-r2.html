NDES is not the first implementation of SCEP for Microsoft CAs. SCEP has previously been implemented as an

add-on service</a> for both Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. NDES is the first native implementation of SCEP for a Microsoft CA, that is introduced in Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several changes in features in NDES that were not available in <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1587.active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-public-key-infrastructure-pki-frequently-asked-questions-faq.aspx#SCEPorNDES">
previous</a> Microsoft implementations of SCEP:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Designate Certificate Templates</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous versions of SCEP did not allow you to configure certificate templates for each request type.
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Certificate Renewal</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; NDES now supports renewing the service certificates.
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>More secure default settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; NDES changes the default settings to more secure values. For example, a password is now required by default for SCEP requests. Also, the maximum number of passwords it caches in memory was reduced from 100
 to 5. </li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Allow SCEP to be installed on a computer other than a CA</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1587.active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-public-key-infrastructure-pki-frequently-asked-questions-faq.aspx#SCEPorNDES">
Previous versions</a> of Microsoft SCEP required that the SCEP service be installed on an existing CA.
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>New default signing algorithm</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous versions of Microsoft SCEP used MD5 as the default hash algorithm. NDES now uses SHA1 as the default but allows you to revert to MD5 through a registry change.
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Service credentials</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; NDES can now run with a dedicated service account or the Network Service account rather than using the Local System account.
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Request size limit</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; NDES limits the request size to 64 KB to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
</li></ul>
