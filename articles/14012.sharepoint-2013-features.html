<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">Microsoft has released SharePoint 2013 preview and lets explore the new features, functional areas and product enhancements in SharePoint 2013 and highlights those new features that developers
 can use in their custom application.<br />

<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">Below are new features introduced in SharePoint 2013:</span></strong></div>

<div style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><span style="font-size:12pt;">Unless a system is simple and intuitive to use, your investment may be wasted because users are not encouraged add content and explore its features. For this reason, each version of SharePoint has made significant improvements
 to usability and SharePoint 2013 is no exception. Document content is readily accessible throughout SharePoint sites, Office applications are thoroughly and intuitively integrated, and comments and tags can be widely used.</span></span></div>
</div>
<span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><br />
</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Office Web Applications</strong><br />
Office Web Applications were available in SharePoint 2010 and enabled users to open and edit Office documents in a browser. In SharePoint 2013, Office Web Applications are more closely integrated in the user interface. For example, in a document library, the
 context menu for a document includes a preview generated by Office Web Applications.
<strong></strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Apps for Office (formerly Office Agave)</strong><br />
Apps for Office are custom user interface elements that users can add to Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to extend functionality. They are built using web technologies such as HTML5 and JavaScript so they work seamlessly in SharePoint
 sites viewed in the browser. </span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Social Networking Support</strong><br />
Social features have been redesigned in SharePoint 2013 and integrated throughout the product to maximize user communication. The My Site has been extended with a micro feed of sites, documents, people, and tags so you can stay informed on all relevant topics.
 There is also a new Community site template.<br />
<br />
<strong></strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Translation Services</strong><br />
Documents in Office formats can be automatically translated by this service<br />
Application. Translation Services makes use of the Bing Translation Service available in the cloud.<br />
<br />
<strong></strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Work Management Services</strong>
<br />
Users may have to check multiple locations for tasks to complete in their workday. By using the Work Management Service application, you can integrate task lists stored in SharePoint, Exchange, and Project Server. The consolidated list is viewable in My Site
 and Outlook so users can more easily plan their time. </span></li></ul>
<span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><br />
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Core Capabilities</strong>
</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Request Management</strong>
<br />
Administrators can use the Request Management feature to distribute<br />
Incoming requests across Web Front-End servers in the SharePoint farm. For example, they can use static weights to route more requests to a new, high specification server and thus take load off an older, slower server. You could also route all requests from
 a particular browser, such as IE9, through a specific server or deny requests from certain IP address ranges.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Shredded Storage</strong><br />
When users make changes to documents, SharePoint 2013 can apply those<br />
changes to the document in the content database without a full refresh of the whole document. If only a single change has been made to a large document, this can enormously reduce the quantity of data sent over the network and, if versioning is used, the volume
 of the content database.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Enterprise Content Management</strong><br />
Many improvements have been made to ECM especially in the field of eDiscovery, which is the process of locating all document records that relate to a specific subject or legal case. You can also use Team Folders to consolidate content stored in SharePoint and
 Exchange.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Web Content Management</strong><br />
In SharePoint 2013, the structure and navigation of a WCM site is defined by managed metadata terms. This approach is highly flexible and enables administrators to reorganize their entire Web site without moving any content.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Search</strong><br />
In SharePoint 2013 there is a single Search engine that combines the best features of the SharePoint and FAST search engines in SharePoint 2010. New configuration objects, such as Query Rules and Result Types allow administrators to customize result sets to
 an unprecedented level.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Client Object Model(CSOM)</strong><br />
The CSOM existed in SharePoint 2010 but has been greatly extended in SharePoint 2013 to enable access to almost all SharePoint 2013 functionality from JavaScript and other client-side code.<strong><br />
</strong></span></li></ul>
</li><li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><span style="font-size:small;"><strong>Life Cycle Management</strong></span><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">In SharePoint 2013 there is a new custom component called the apps for SharePoint. This is the recommended way for developers and third parties to create new functionality and user
 interface components. However the SharePoint 2013 Apps infrastructure also benefits SharePoint administrators by making it easier to manage the life cycle of custom applications.</span></strong></span>
</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Sharepoint Market Place</strong><br />
This global marketplace for apps for SharePoint is a single repository of custom components, available to all SharePoint customers. Administrators can enable users to purchase apps, on behalf of the company from the marketplace, or restrict that right to a
 small number of budget holders. Once purchased, an app becomes available to all users in the SharePoint farm.<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Corporate App Catalog</strong><br />
This catalog is a private repository of apps within the SharePoint farm and controlled by farm administrators. Users can choose to install these apps in any SharePoint site in the organization.<strong><br />
</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:small;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Remove Apps</strong><br />
Apps for SharePoint is contained entirely within a sub-site of the SharePoint site in which it is used. Therefore, whennt Market Place</strong><br />
This global marketplace for apps for SharePoint is a single repository of custom components, available to all SharePoint customers. Administrators can enable users to purchase apps, on behalf of the company from the marketplace, or restrict that right to a
 small number of budget holders. Once purchased, an app becomes available to all users in the SharePoin a user or administrator removes the app, the sub-site is removed cleanly and no objects are retained in the parent site or elsewhere. This
 clean removal aids app management. </span></li><li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><span style="font-size:small;"><strong>Multi Tenant Farms</strong><br />
In a multi-tenant SharePoint farm, there is a one Corporate App Catalog for each tenant organization. This ensures that both tenants must pay for their app usage and that removals do not impact other tenants.</span><strong><br />
