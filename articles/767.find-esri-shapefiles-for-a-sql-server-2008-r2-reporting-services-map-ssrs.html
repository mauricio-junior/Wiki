<p>ESRI shapefiles&nbsp;contain data that complies with the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) shapefile spatial data format. ESRI shapefiles are available on the Web from a variety of sites. The term &quot;shapefile&quot; applies to a set of related files.
 To add a map to a report, you must have both the .shp file that contains spatial data and the matching&nbsp;.dbf file that contains supporting information.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Spatial data and other data that is contained in ESRI shapefiles can be politically sensitive and possibly copyrighted. Check the terms of use and privacy statements for the ESRI shapefiles to understand
 how you can use spatial data in your report.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;">Finding ESRI Shapefiles from Public Domain Sites</span></p>
<p>You can download ESRI files from public domain data sources on the Web, including government and university sites. For example, the built-in map feature in SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services uses data from TIGER/Line Shapefiles provided courtesy of the
 U.S. Census Bureau (<a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a>). TIGER/Line Shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census MAF/TIGER database. TIGER/Line Shapefiles are available without charge
 from the U.S. Census Bureau. To obtain more information about the TIGER/Line Shapefiles go to
<a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger">http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger</a>. The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes
 does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land descriptions. Census TIGER and TIGER/Line are registered trademarks of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</p>
