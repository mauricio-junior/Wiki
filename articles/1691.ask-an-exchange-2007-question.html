Q: How to cut down the size of a freakin&#39; huge Exchange 2007 mailbox?</strong><br />
<strong>So yeah I have a client that turned on journaling for their main mailstore ever since the server was put in 1.5 years ago. Unfortunately they didn&#39;t do any type of archiving so the journal mailbox is now over 700 GB in size and any searches on it run
 very slowly (imagine that!). They were trying to use the export-mailbox cmdlet to archive off some mail but at this point even archiving a few days worth is running in the 12&#43; hour timeframe. Any suggestions?
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;A: Export-Mailbox exports all and then searches and deletes items that do not match the set criterias, so export all that need to be archived in one run. For example, to archive everything older than a year, use the<em> -EndDate
</em>parameter with <em>(get-date).addyears(-1).toshortdatestring() </em>as value.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: How&nbsp;do&nbsp;I set Exchange 2007 to suppress out of office message going to distribution groups?
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A: On the Set-DistributionGroup cmdlet, or the Set-DynamicDistributionGroup cmdlet,&nbsp;use the
<em>SendOofMessageToOriginatorEnabled</em> parameter allows Out of Office messages to be delivered to the senders of e-mail messages that are sent to this distribution group. Just set it to $false, which is the default setting.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: Hey what is the default replication interval in Exchange 2007? intstant/ 15 mins etc? For example, if I make a simple distribution list change in the EMC, the change is instant in exchange but not immediate via an
 outlook 2007 client. I found taking off outlook cached mode speeds up the change on the client end,&nbsp; but still not as instant as Exchange 2003 used to be- also any change to the GAL could be updated via recipient policy in 2003 for quick change; but running
 update on the &#39;GAL&#39; in 2007 does not appear to be as quick. What are your thoughts on this?
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A: Clients use the Offline Address Book to lookup recipients.
<span class="highlightblue bold" style="font-size:12px;"><strong><span style="font-size:12px;background-color:#d7e9fe;">By default, Exchange generates the Offline Address Book once a day at 4:00 AM</span></strong></span>, unless you change the schedule. New
 recipients do not show up in the OAB till Exchange udpates it.&nbsp; You can force a update of the OAB on the server, then you will need to run the following PowerShell command
<span style="font-size:12px;color:#000000;">update-filedistributionservice -identity Servername&nbsp;&nbsp; now update the GAL on your fat client.</span></span></p>

Q: I am trying to configure autodiscover on a second web site. I have assigned a unique cert to the site with exact FQDN on the Subject alternate Name. I have set the SCPs for both internal and external to:
</span><a href="https://autodiscover.domain.com/"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>https://autodiscover.domain.com</strong></span></a><span style="font-size:12px;">. However, when I run test-outlookwebservices | fl, I get the following: &quot;ID 1013 Type: Error

 remote servers returned an error: (401) Unauthorized ID 1006 Type: Error Message: Failed to contact AutoDiscover&quot; However , how to resolve this problem? Outlook anywhere and active sync will not work properly&nbsp;if cannot resolve it. OWA is 100% working and the
 certificate installed has correct web site name on subject alternate name settings and i am very sure the certificate setting is correct. The IIS Autodiscover sub-web setting also confimed same as the default installation setting If using IE browse the web

 reflection attacks on your computer.&nbsp; Authentication fails if the FQDN or the custom host header that you use does not match the local computer name.&quot; You can get around the error by disabling the loopback check (not recommended due to security issues and
 reboot required) or by specifying the FQDN of the newly created autodiscover host in the registry key documented in the KB896861 article.

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: Is it possible to create a 64-bit Exchange test deployment on VMWare?</strong>
<br />
<br />
A: Exchange 2007 works in VMware Server 1.0 (and higher) as well as VMWare ESX 3.0.1 (and higher) in a i386 and x64 environment, however the host system must meet specific processor requirements as detailed by VMWare at
</span><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/evand/archive/2007/02/19/filterable-properties-in-exchange-2007-rtm.aspx"><span style="font-size:12px;">http://blogs.technet.com/evand/archive/2007/02/19/filterable-properties-in-exchange-2007-rtm.aspx</span></a><span style="font-size:12px;">:
 AMD Athlon 64 (revision D or later), AMD Opteron (revision E or later), AMD Turion 64 (revision E or later), AMD Sempron (64-bit-capable revision D or later), Intel EM64T VT-capable processors. Otherwise 64-bit guest systems are not supported. This setup is
 also not directly supported by Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Also be careful if you are going to perform NLB within the VMware environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refer to
</span><a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1556"><span style="font-size:12px;text-decoration:underline;color:#800080;">http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1556</span></a><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;for

<strong>Q: Exchange 2007 creates log files for the mailbox databases in the location where Exchange 2007 was installed. How can I move the log files for the databases after the installation has completed?</strong>
<br />
<br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Q: How do I create a System Policy in Exchange 2007?</strong> <br />
<br />
A: System Policies are not included in Exchange 2007. A much more powerful and flexible tool in PowerShell has been created. In order to apply settings you can create a PowerShell Script to make those settings and the schedule it with Windows Scheduler so that
 they are reapplied periodically. A simple example of doing this can be found [http://blogs.technet.com/evand/archive/2007/02/19/filterable-properties-in-exchange-2007-rtm.aspx here].&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: In the collaboration world a web portal is an easy way to share information. Has there been any attempts at creating a.war file for Exchange web access through a portal? The if not a JBoss portal server has it
 been done for a Microsoft SharePoint server? <br />
<br />
</strong>A: There are a number of webparts for Microsoft SharePoint that integrate a variety of Exchange features such as Calendaring and full email clients. There are also&nbsp; a number of JBoss portlets available.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: Is there any insight regarding Antivirus or Anti-Spam software for Exchange 2007? I am hesitant to trust the software that comes &quot;built-in&quot; from MS. I have used GFI in the past for Exchange 2003 but since its not
 100% compatible with 2007, I hesitate to buy that as well. Any suggestions or ideas?
<br />
</strong><br />
A: The Forefront for Exchange product seems to be the best thought-out product as it is the next generation Antigen product. If you haven&#39;t looked at Forefront I would seriously consider it (no I don&#39;t work for Microsoft). Otherwise hang on for a little bit
 for the other vendors to release a supported version for Exchange Server 2007. </span>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: What are the recommendations for Domain Controllers in an Exchange 2007 Environment? With 2007 It seems Exchange will be using AD allot more and adding Domain Controllers seems inevitable.
<br />
</strong><br />
A: The same Exchange processor core to GC processor core ratio of 4:1 is recommended for Exchange Server 2007 as was recommended for Exchange Server 2003 when using x86 Domain Controllers. If you have x64 Domain Controllers with enough memory to cache the entire
 Active Directory database you can use a 8:1 ratio. It is also very important to have the AD sites properly defined in order to route mail. More information can be found [http://blogs.technet.com/evand/archive/2007/02/19/filterable-properties-in-exchange-2007-rtm.aspx

<br />
</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: I am currently evaluating Exchange 2007 and am stumped by an issue. It seems by default to force the client to NOT use cached mode, how do I enable cached mode for the outlook client?
<br />
</strong><br />
A: This is an Outlook question. Exchange doesn&#39;t turn cached mode on or off for the Outlook client. You might look at Group Policy to see if there&#39;s a way to force this setting... or alternately, you can manage cached mode on a per-client basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: Running Get-OutlookProvider in the EMC shows that neither the EXCH, EXPR nor WEB entries have any content in the &quot;SSL&quot; column. I want to set this SSL property to &quot;true&quot;. but running the set-outlookprovider -id
 exch -ssl:true&#39; command returns an error saying that the parameter -ssl is invalid. Checking with &quot;help get-outlookprovider&quot; shows that the switch is unlisted. I know from other posts that it was there in Beta, but has it been removed in the final release?
 If yes, how do I set the parameter to &quot;true&quot;? <br />
</strong><br />
A: Outlook requires SSL and Exchange 2007 always preconfigures with a self-signed SSL cert. It&#39;s not something that can be turned on/off anymore (this is why the switch is gone since the earlier beta).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: Exchange 2007 was installed in a child domain (child.domain.com) after setup /prepareAD was ran in the root domain (domain.com). All was working well, until I found out that there&#39;s another child domain (child2.domain.com).
 setup /preparedomain wasn&#39;t run in this other child domain prior to installing Exchange 2007. I ran setup /preparedomain:child2.domain.com to try to correct the problem, and it finished without any errors. However, when managing mailboxes on the Exchange 2007
 server, the only domain that is possible to create mailboxes for is child.domain.com. What am I missing in getting this set up to allow the new Exchange 2007 server in child.domain.com provide mailboxes for child2.domain.com as well? A page on adding additional
 child domains would probably be nice for this page. <br />
</strong><br />
A: It sounds like your scope is set to the first child domain and not the 2nd child domain. You can manage your recipient scope from the Recipient Configuration node of EMC (&quot;Modify Recipient Scope...&quot; option in the action pane). This will let you select either
 one of the child domains, or the entire forest as your working recipient scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: How can you prevent a Distribution List from being placed in the To: field of an email? I want to force users to put the Distribution Lists in the BCC: field only.
<br />
</strong><br />
A: You can&#39;t. The only possible way to accomplish this is to deploy a custom Outlook form that has some logic built-in that would remove DLs from the To: line. Then again, there&#39;s nothing stopping the users from expanding the DL (which would replace the DL
 with its members) or use OWA, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP etc etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: We are trying to bring in a new Exchange 2007 server but having a few problems planning it. We currently have a Exchange 2003 server in place. I am wanting to add the new Exchange 2007 server to the network will the
 same name as the old Exchange 2003 server. But obviously you cant have 2 servers on the same network with the same name and Exchange 2007 needs the network to install, but then on the other hand i dont to create a huge downtime. Keeping the same as the old
 server for the new server will save me a lot of time. I have been reading someone elses post on here and they were advised to run the new server along side the old server, but that means you eventually have the new server with a different name where as i want
 the new server to keep the name same as the old Exchange server. How would i go about doing this?
<br />
</strong><br />
A: In general, it&#39;s much easier to bring up the new server with a new name and move mailboxes. Outlook will recover from this automatically by redirecting the connection from the old server to the new server on first connect after the move. This is how I&#39;ve
 seen it done almost universally. If your goal is to end up with the same servername (you have some vanity servername you wish to preserve, etc) you can do a leap-frog move. Setup the new server and move everyone to it. Then setup a second new server (or on
 the new hardware, etc) with the original servername and move everyone back.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: We are moving mailboxes from 2003 to 2007 and have found that some Outlook clients will see this change and amend the Outlook client to the new 2007 server. Some clients will not and we have to delete the Outlook
 profile and re-create. Upon recreation, the Outlook profile sees the mailbox on 2007 and configures correctly. Not able to find a common denominator on why this and wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions.
<br />
</strong><br />
A: If you move the mailbox between servers in the same Exchange organization (same forest), Outlook should redirect just fine. If you move mailboxes cross-forest, this redirection won&#39;t happen automatically in Outlook 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I am getting ready to install Exchange 2003 soon (cant afford 2007 hardware yet). I am also looking to add VoIP to our office in a limited way. Can Exchange 2003 work with 3rd party solutions for voicemail &amp; faxes etc?</strong>
<br />
<br />
A: Sure, there are 3rd-party voicemail and fax solutions for Exchange, such as Cisco Call Manager, many PBX vendors have some solution for this.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: I am using Outlook Anywhere with Outlook 2007. Works well internally and externally, however for external users outside out network who use Outlook 2007 it keeps asking for a password to the exchange server. They
 can get in with the password but when they try to send and receive any emails it keeps asking for a password. There is no option to save password. Is there any setting to save this password?</strong>
<br />
<br />
A: No, you cannot save the password, but you can, as a work around, add it&nbsp;to your &nbsp;password management (control panel, user management).&nbsp; The real question is why does it keep prompting you..it should not.&nbsp; It sounds like your certificate or something is not
 set correctly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: I have a 32 bit 2003 server OS on a server with a 64 bit processor. Will Exchange 2007 load onto that?&nbsp;
<br />
</strong><br />
A: Yes it will, but this is only supported for test labs (32bit Exchange 2007 on 32-bit OS). Your better option is to refresh the OS on this server to be 64bit OS and then you can properly run Exchange 2007 (64bit) on this server.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;<strong>Q: If end user has configured outlook on his desktop and his mailbox is moved to Exchange 2007 server from Exchange 2003, then can the user access his mailbox without reconfiguring his outlook profile?
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A: Yes with the most current version of Outlook XP SP3 and Outlook 2003 SP 3, this works fine. Allow for replication to the clients, otherwise the client will provide errors when opening too soon. Also, moving the user to a different
 mailbox server has the same results.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: I have Impersonation setup for an account to access all others accounts for an App using EWS and this works fine. However, I need to access them using webDAV too but only the user who&#39;s mailbox it is can log in to
 them. I did have this working but deleted the account to try recreating it to document what was required and now cant access any mailboxes even though the ms-Exch_EPI* permissions are set on the server, mailbox database and individual users. Anyone know what
 else is required for the Http access?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A:&nbsp;Mailbox permissions are required over and above Impersonation settings then it all works, see the Tips and Tricks page and Mailbox permissions.
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q: I would like to upgrade a custom address list which is filtered by LDAP as below to Exchange 2007 address list type;<br />

<br />
A:&nbsp; The following should work;<br />
Set-AddressList &quot;yourlistname&quot; -RecipientFilter { Alias -ne $Null -and SamAccountName -like &#39;Adv*&#39; }&nbsp;<br />
Hint: You can use any attribute you find using Get-Mailbox in the -RecipientFilter.&nbsp;To see all values use -GetMailbox -Identity (account) |fl command.&nbsp;

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">Q: I have a couple of questions...: I manage a W2K domain called &#39;example1.com.ar&#39;. There are 5 exchange servers in this organization. Now, we are trying to move all the domain to a new domain
 (w2k3) called &#39;example1.com&#39;. In this new domain I&#39;ve installed a Exchange 2007. I&#39;ve created a trust relationship between example1.com.ar and example1.com. Now I want to start moving users &amp; mailbox from example1.com.ar to example1.com but the new example1.com
 users can&#39;t stop receiving mails to @example1.com.ar... How can I do that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A: If you use the Active directory Integration Feature pack (The stripped down Version of MIIS - and which is free) you can synchronise the directories of the two domains. Make sure that the old and new namespaces are allowed
 in both forests, in the new forest make sure that example1.com.ar is listed as a &quot;non Authoritative&quot; domain, that is that the servers will accept mail to anyone who is a local user with a &quot;@example1.com.ar&quot; address, and then make sure that it has a route to
 forward any unresolved mails back to the old domain email bridgehead. When you use the EXchange 2007 migrate user tools to move the users from the old to the new forest, there is an option to change the old user account into a contact object as part of the
 move, and as long as the route exists in the old exchange org to point to example1.com then any mails that come in for migrated users will get forwarded to the users&#39; new mailbox
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q:&nbsp; I am currently trying to setup the Document Feature in OWA 2007.&nbsp; Is it possible to make it so external users can access a local windows shares on one of our servers?&nbsp; If this is possible, how would this be done and
 if not could some please tell me the best alternative to getting a local windows share.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A: Yes, goto EMC.&nbsp; Open the properties on Server Configuration\Client Access\owa (Default Web Site).&nbsp; Click the &quot;Remote File Servers&quot; tab.&nbsp; Configure the policy.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Then from an OWA client the users need to click the Documents tab then click &quot;Open Location&quot;

<p><span style="font-size:12px;font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Q: Is it possible to create custom dynamic distribution lists that use multivalued fields such as departmentNumber?<br />
<br />
Example <br />
New-DynamicDistributionGroup -Name &quot;Pacific Northwest&quot; -Alias &quot;Pacific_Northwest&quot; -OrganizationalUnit &quot;Contoso.com/Users&quot; -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq &#39;UserMailbox&#39;) -and ((StateOrProvince -eq &#39;Washington&#39; -or StateOrProvince -eq &#39;Oregon&#39;)))} -RecipientContainer
 &quot;Contoso.com&quot;<br />
<br />
I have several users that can be members of multiple &quot;departments&quot; or &quot;roles&quot; and to accommodate this we long ago started using the departmentNumber attribute to store those nonprimary departments. Exchange 2003 was able to send to these just fine using the
 old LDAP syntax but I cannot seem to find a way to make OPATH do the same. Does anyone know a way to do this? It is NOT practical for me to use 1 field per additional role/department because some users may have 2 or 3 extra and i&#39;d have to then account for
 each of those in about 30 distribution lists. Even if I did then what happens when I have someone who needs a 4th a year down the road. I know how to make 2007 use the old syntax using ADSIEdit which I will do if I absolutely have to but to me this is a kludge
 and I should not have to do this. Plus it worries me that these would not be supported anymore in Exchange 2010.</strong>

Q: On the receive connector you can specify a defaultdomain. This is very handy for hosters (like me) who want to masquerade the generic domain in NDR reports etc. The option is there, the explanation says you can fill in any of the domains in accepted domains

Q: I&#39;m running Exchange 2007 multi-role (hub, cas, mailbox) on a dual quadcore box. I have 8GB of physical memory and i&#39;m noticing that store.exe on an average consumes only about 1/4 to 1/2 of available physical memory, yet its consuming almost my entire pagefile.
 I had planned on installing more physical memory, however I am wondering what exactly that is going to do for me? If I have 8GB right now and its not utilizing all of it on a regular basis, why would putting 32GB make any difference? Bottom line my question
 is this, Why is Exchange preferring to utilize page file over physical RAM?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">Q. We have new fresh install of Exchange 2007, with SP1 installed and the post SP1 rollup installed. In OWA we cannot get Options &gt; Rules to display correctly or the new Monthly Calendar view to display correctly. In
 Rules there are just the basic words with no buttons or formatting and the calendar view is just a grey background with the day numbers and no items displayed - they are displayed correctly in the Day\Week views. We have the same issue on a test server setup.

<p><strong><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">Q: My company wants to make emails to our Board of Directors secure. &nbsp;One way to do this would be to use a secure email service, but we want to keep the email in house. &nbsp;Therefore what we want to do is give internal
 email addresses to all the members of the board and have them check our mail system (securely) for any communications. &nbsp;Obviously the problem with that is that they will not frequently check our email system if at all. &nbsp;Further, we don&#39;t want them to use any
 method other than webmail to ensure that confidential information does not leave our network. &nbsp;Therefore what we want to do is send them confidential emails to their internal email address and then have Exchange 2007 automatically notify them that there is
 a message waiting. &nbsp;We see that we could use a transport rule to forward the email, but we don&#39;t want them to actually get a copy of the email, just a canned message that says - &quot;You&#39;ve got mail waiting at your internal company account, click here to log in
 to webmail.&quot;</span></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">Q: Is there any way of replicating &#39;plussed&#39; addressing (a-la Linux) in Exchange 2007.&nbsp; On the Linux platform users could create a random email address (ie.&nbsp;
</span><a href="mailto:joe&#43;fishlist@domain.com"><span style="font-size:12px;">joe&#43;fishlist@domain.com</span></a><span style="font-size:12px;">) by adding a &#39;plussed&#39; (ie. &#43;fishlist) to his normal email address (ie.
</span><a href="mailto:joe@domain.com"><span style="font-size:12px;">joe@domain.com</span></a><span style="font-size:12px;">).&nbsp; When the server processed an incoming mail the mail addressed to the &#39;plussed&#39; address would be delivered to the inbox as normal (this
 part Exchange 2007 seems to do just fine)... but if the user had created a folder within his IMAP folder structure with a matching name (ie. fishlist) the email would be automatically delivered by the server into that folder rather than the inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was always
 a great solution for mailing list subscriptions, &#39;disposable&#39; email addresses... and the nice thing being that it required absolutely no configuration by the user nor the admin (except the user creating a folder) and has the added benefit of not using up a
 whole&nbsp;bunch of the user&#39;s allocated &#39;rules quota&#39; on the server.&nbsp; I&#39;m going into withdrawal without having this in Exchange... would LOVE to be able to replicate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially all that needs to happen is look at the recipient address of every message
 that is to be delivered locally to the message store, if the email address contains a &#43; sign then try to deliver the message to a folder within the recipient&#39;s mailbox comprised of whatever text is between the &#39;&#43;&#39; and the
</span><a href="mailto:%27@%27"><span style="font-size:12px;">&#39;@&#39;</span></a><span style="font-size:12px;">, if that folder doesn&#39;t exist in the user&#39;s mailbox then just deliver to their inbox as normal.&nbsp; Seems like it should be sooooo simple... but that probably
 means it&#39;s insanely hard or impossible :-)&nbsp; Can fudge it with many client-side rules... but one single global server-side one would be amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!!!!</span></strong><span style="font-size:12px;">

<p><strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp;We migrated to Exch07 last year from Exch 03. We had both Exch 03 and 07 servers in place during the migration. As part of the migration, we moved the OAB generation to one of the new Exch07 servers.
 After the migration was complete, we took down the connectors and decommissioned the old Exch servers. They are still in use as DCs, but no longer have Exch
<span style="font-size:12px;">services running on them and are not &#39;seen&#39; by the new Exch07 environment. We recently tried to do a bulk update to the OAB to update all of our user&#39;s contact info in AD that was edited, and got this error: Database &quot;fpainc.local/Configuration/Deleted
 Objects/Public Folder Store (FPMAIL1) DEL:76c75b8b-1b7a-47c0-a6df-f05424b3e3c9&quot; was not found. Please make sure you have typed it correctly.<br />
FPMail1 is the old Exch03 server that was originally the OAB generation server. All the Public folders were moved to a different server. It looks like there is somehow a remnant of the old setup stuck in AD, but we aren&#39;t sure how to clean that out. Any suggestions?
 Thx SJ53 <br />

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Dimitri - Easiest way to add a question is to sign-in and &quot;edit&quot; the page, adding your question to the bottom of the &quot;not yet answered&quot; section.
