<h1><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>The following guidelines are designed to provide you with practical ways to implement the user interaction design principles for Microsoft Surface experiences.</p>
<p>Each set of guidelines comprises three categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="unordered"> The <em>must</em> category provides the minimum requirements you need to meet to adhere to the design principles. The <em>must</em> guidelines also describe characteristics that are required by the Surface application certification process. Each guideline cites specific requirements as appropriate.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"> The <em>should</em> category describes guidelines that provide excellent experiences for users and that you can implement at a relatively low cost by using Surface tools.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"> The <em>could</em> category lists guidelines that we recommend so that your application provides a more complete, desirable, and fulfilling user experience. However, these guidelines might also cost more so you should prioritize them accordingly. These guidelines might also apply only to particular application scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create a complete, believable universe by making objects on the screen behave just as objects in the real world behave. You can subtly incorporate principles of physics in how objects move, their inertia, and what occurs when multiple objects collide to help enhance the fidelity of the virtual environment.</p>

<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>You can affix either of two kinds of tags to a physical object to elicit a specific response. A <em>tag</em> is a special pattern of dots. The tag consists of a geometric arrangement of areas that reflect and absorb infrared (IR) light. There are two types of tags: <em>byte tags</em> (which encode an 8-bit number) and <em>identity tags</em> (which encode a 64-bit number). For more information about tags, see the Microsoft Surface SDK Help documentation.</p>
<p>When a user places a tagged object on a Microsoft Surface screen, the vision system reads the tag and determines its value, location, and orientation. The vision system also interprets any other portion of the object that reflects IR light as a contact and sends information to the application. You must then create a visual response appropriate to that object.</p>

<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody">
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>An untagged object is referred to as a <em>blob</em>. Microsoft Surface can detect infrared (IR)-reflective objects that users place on the screen. In many cases, the Surface unit identifies these objects as multiple contacts (identified as either blobs or fingers) for each contiguous IR-reflective portion of the object. The vision system cannot determine whether adjacent blobs are part of the same physical object and cannot identify untagged physical objects. An application treats contacts from untagged objects the same as contacts from other objects that register as blobs, such as an entire hand that someone places on the Surface screen.</p>

<div id="mainSection">

<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>At any given time, multiple users who are working around a Microsoft Surface unit might be engaged in multiple levels of <em>task coupling</em>. Consider how to best support different levels of coupling in tasks, and how to support varying levels of coupling in the same application. There are three levels of task coupling:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Highly coupled tasks</em>: Users help each other accomplish the same task. For example, two users touch two portions of the same object to perform a manipulation, or two users look for the same album in a large collection.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Lightly coupled tasks</em>: Two users try to achieve a result that depends on them both, but they are engaged in different tasks to achieve it (sometimes called <em>divide and conquer</em>). For example, one user searches for an album in a large collection while the other users search for album art to apply to it, or the fire chief and police chief sit at a Surface unit and manage different elements of a crisis.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Uncoupled tasks</em>: Users share the same space, but they are engaged in separate tasks. For example, two users search through the same collection of photographs, but each user looks for different pictures, or one user searches for photographs, while the other user checks e-mail.</li>

<p>Users can clearly see and recognize objects, content, and other elements from a distance. When users move closer, they see more detail, such as additional information, subtle textures, or hints of reflected light. When users interact with interface elements, those elements reveal a finer level of detail through sounds, visual feedback, and movement. For example, icons in Launcher transform into application previews when a user touches them, and then they change into the live applications when a user touches them again. These actions provide progressively more detail with deeper interactions. As users zoom in closer to objects, the objects should reveal unexpected visual or audible details.</p>

<p>Users enjoy &quot;playing&quot; with multitouch input and seeing responses for that input. This includes responses that are purely enjoyable and not necessarily functional, and responses that are integral to the action or purpose of the application. Microsoft Surface experiences should focus on highly crafted representations of content, motion, and sound to help create fun, pleasurable experiences of the highest possible quality. The interaction should focus on the quality of the journey, not just completing tasks. For example, the transition from a stack view of photos into a grid view supports the task of browsing more content, but the transition occurs seamlessly as the container&rsquo;s shape changes and resizes and the content gently moves to indicate scrolling.</p>
<p>Design Surface experiences with a framework that starts with familiar metaphors and objects and then exposes additional possibilities as the interaction unfolds. Over time, this framework enables users to progressively enjoy more capabilities and draws them deeper into the experience.</p>

<p>A Microsoft Surface application should contain levels of depth that move users smoothly from their first touch to full engagement with the application. If instructions are necessary, integrate them with the natural flow of use and do not steer attention away from content. If you are trying to reveal the existence of functions, make those functions apparent at the right moment (when they have an effect). If the application teaches techniques, such as gestures, demonstrate those techniques through affordances and constraints that guide the gesture.</p>

<p>Because of the spatial capabilities of Microsoft Surface applications, you can enable users to navigate through an environment and provide on-demand, deeper views of an object (also known as <em>progressive disclosure</em>). For example, users can zoom into a photo to reveal deeper content and functionality.</p>
<p>The following guidelines describe how to use progressive disclosure to help users learn as they use Surface applications.</p>

<p>Touch, gesture, and direct manipulation in Microsoft Surface experiences move away from discrete actions toward continuous action. In GUI applications, discrete actions are mostly brief, single-click actions that users perform in a sequence to complete a task. For example, to move an object from one location to another, a user would select the object, select the appropriate command, and then move the object.</p>
<p>In contrast, direct manipulation favors continuous actions. To move an object from one location to another, the user can just grab it and move it to its new location, as shown in the following illustration.</p>

<p>A <em>gesture</em> refers to a physical action. Many systems use gestures like shortcut keys, which makes them independent of the particular physical location where the user interacts with content. In contrast, Microsoft Surface uses <em>manipulation gestures</em>. The distinction between system gestures and manipulation gestures is important:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="unordered"> Manipulation gestures are physical movements of virtual content within an application.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"> System gestures are movements that indirectly affect the on-screen content.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of gestures can use identical physical actions, but on-screen graphics guide and provide affordances for manipulation gestures. The use of manipulations relates to the principle of scaffolding.</p>
