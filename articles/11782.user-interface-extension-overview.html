<p>An add-in entry for a view must be created in the add-in package manifest. This entry references the view provided by a Microsoft .NET assembly. For more information, see <a class="ExistingPageLink" href="/wiki/contents/articles/11743.manifests.aspx" title="Click to view the page titled: Manifests">Manifests</a>. For an example on how to create a manifest entry, see [[How to Define
 a View in the Manifest]].</p>

<div class="section" id="sectionSection1">
<p>A view add-in is created by creating a class that inherits from the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
Microsoft.SystemCenter.VirtualMachineManager.UIAddIns.ViewAddInBase</span> base class. Your class should then declare the
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">System.Addin.AddinAttribute</span> attribute, assigning it a unique name between all your other add-ins.</p>
<p>The ribbon button created by the console for your add-in uses the manifest to define the caption of the button. However, if you want to change the caption when your add-in is loaded, for example if you wanted to translate the text into another language,
 you can override the <strong>GetButtonLabelString</strong> method.</p>
<p>The view base class provides two methods for add-ins. The first method is <strong>
CreateViewControl</strong>. This method is called when the console first displays your view and it will never be called again. This method returns a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">FrameworkElement</span> object instance. The object returned is the user control that will be displayed in the console. The console caches reference to that user control you will want to make sure that you do too. The
 second method provided by the view base class is <strong>SetCurrentScope</strong>. This method is called when the console changes the current context type and context object targeted by the view.</p>
