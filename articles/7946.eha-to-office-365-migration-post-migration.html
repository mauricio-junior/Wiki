Consider Exporting EHA Reports Within 15 Days After Migration-Complete</b><br />
After Migration-Complete you should log on to the EHA Reports and export any that you want to retain. EHA has thirteen built in reports. For example, the Roster Report and Privileged Roles reports are useful for configuring Office 365 with the same administrative permissions and roles that existed in EHA. To see a description of all the available EHA reports visit the <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/11571.reports.aspx">Reports </a></span><a href="http://getarchiving.com/" target="_self"><span style="font-family:calibri;"><span style="color:#000000;">page.<br />

<strong>Configure Office 365 Accounts<br />
</strong>EHA Administrative permissions and Archive Roles do not migrate from EHA to Office 365. The main contact at your company will be given the credentials to logon to Office 365. This account is capable of configuring your migrated accounts to match their equivalent authority in EHA.<br />
