<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>You can decode and save quarantined items to disk. When doing so, you should be aware that this file is now a potentially live virus, so it is recommended that you only perform this activity for files that you believe are false positives. The files are saved
 with their original names; if there is a conflict, an ID is appended to the end of the file name in order to denote that there are multiple files with the same name, for example,
<em>filename</em>_<em>ID1</em>.doc, <em>filename</em>_ <em>ID2</em>.doc, and so on.
</p>
To save quarantined items to disk
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
<p>In the Forefront Protection 2010 for Exchange Server Administrator Console, click
<strong>Monitoring</strong>, and under <strong>Server Security Views</strong>, click
<strong>Quarantine</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Server Security Views - Quarantine </strong>pane, select one or more items. Right-click and then click
<strong>Save</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Save Selected Items</strong> dialog box, in the <strong>Output Path</strong> box, type or browse (by clicking
<strong>Change</strong>) to the location where you want to save the items, and then click
<strong>Save</strong>. </p>
<p>If you receive a message that the file was saved successfully, you can click <strong>
Open Folder</strong> to easily access the saved items.</p>
</li></ol>

<h2 class="heading"><a name="Delivering_quarantined_items_using_e-mail"></a>Delivering quarantined items using e-mail</h2>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection1">
<p>You can deliver quarantined items to specified recipients using e-mail. When doing so, you should be aware that this file is now a potentially live virus, so it is recommended that you only perform this activity for files that you believe are false positives.
</p>
<p>When quarantined items are delivered to the user&#39;s mailbox, they are included as an attachment to a new e-mail message. Tag text in the subject line identifies that the message contains a delivered quarantined item. This text, which cannot be changed, is
 “Message delivered from Microsoft Forefront Protection for Exchange Server Quarantine”. When the user opens the attachment, the original message launches within Microsoft Office Outlook as a separate message.
</p>
<div class="alert">
<p>On an Edge Server, because FPE has no access to Active Directory Domain Services, you must enter a full e-mail address with a fully qualified domain name, even if delivery is to an addressee inside your Exchange organization. If you don&#39;t&nbsp;enter a fully qualified
 domain name, then FPE won&#39;t be able to&nbsp;deliver mail from quarantine. </p>
</div>
To deliver quarantined items
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Monitoring</strong>, and under <strong>Server Security Views</strong>, click
<strong>Quarantine</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Server Security Views - Quarantine </strong>pane, select one or more items. Right-click and then click
<strong>Deliver</strong> in order to deliver the quarantined items to specified recipients.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Deliver Selected Items</strong> dialog box, indicate the recipients for the items being delivered.</p>
<p>You can select the <strong>Send to original recipients</strong> check box in order to deliver the quarantined items to the original recipients of the messages. You can also manually input e-mail addresses for the
<strong>To</strong>, <strong>Cc</strong>, and <strong>Bcc</strong> recipients. You can input multiple e-mail addresses if they are separated by a semicolon (;).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Send</strong> to deliver the quarantined items to the specified recipients.
</p>
</li></ol>
<div class="alert">
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">If a delivered message is still detected by the scan engines as being an infected file, it will again fail to be delivered to the intended recipients. However, by default, delivered messages are not rescanned for filter matches.
 You can configure FPE to rescan delivered messages for filter matches by performing the following step: in the
<strong>Configuration – Quarantine Options</strong> pane, select the <strong>Rescan filters on send</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Save</strong>.</span> </p>

<h3 class="subHeading"><a name="Logging_delivered_quarantine_items"></a>Logging delivered quarantine items</h3>
<div class="subSection">
<p>The DeliverLog.txt text file provides a log of items that have been delivered from quarantine. When an item is delivered from quarantine the first time, DeliverLog.txt is created. Subsequent delivered quarantined items are appended to DeliverLog.txt. DeliverLog.txt
 is located in the FPE data folder.&nbsp; </p>

<h2 class="heading"><a name="Deleting_quarantined_items"></a>Deleting quarantined items</h2>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection2">
<p>Over time, you might find that you have accumulated a large number of quarantined items. If you find that quarantine is becoming difficult to manage or you are running low on disk space, you may want to delete selected quarantined items. If many items are
 selected, be aware that the deletion process can take a long time. </p>
To delete selected quarantined items
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Monitoring</strong>, and under <strong>Server Security Views</strong>, click
<strong>Quarantine</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Server Security Views - Quarantine</strong> pane, select one or more items. Right-click and then click
<strong>Delete</strong>. When you are asked to confirm your decision, click <strong>
Yes</strong>. This deletes the selected items listed on the <strong>Server Security Views - Quarantine</strong> pane, as well as the files stored on disk.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>You can also elect to delete all quarantined items; this is faster than deleting selected quarantined items.</p>
To delete all quarantined items
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Monitoring</strong>, and under <strong>Server Security Views</strong>, click
<strong>Quarantine</strong>. </p>
</li><li>

<div class="section" id="sectionSection3">
<p>You can configure FPE to automatically purge quarantined items after they are a certain number of days old. If the purge function is enabled, all quarantined items (both the displayed records and the actual files stored on disk) that are older than the specified
 number of days are deleted. </p>
To purge quarantined items after a certain number of days
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Monitoring</strong>, and under <strong>Configuration</strong>, click

<strong>Actions</strong>, click <strong>Configure Quarantine Options</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Configuration - Quarantine Options</strong> pane, select the <strong>
Automatically purge quarantined items</strong> check box. This causes the <strong>
Purge after (days)</strong> field to become available.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Purge after (days)</strong> field, indicate the number of days after which items will be purged. All items older than the specified number of days will be deleted. The default is 30 days.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. Setting or changing the purge value takes effect only after being saved.</p>
</li></ol>
To suspend purging
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Configuration - Quarantine Options</strong> pane, clear the <strong>
Automatically purge quarantined items</strong> check box, and then click <strong>
Save</strong>. The value in the <strong>Purge after (days)</strong> field remains, but no purging takes place until the
<strong>Automatically purge quarantined items</strong> check box is selected again.</p>
