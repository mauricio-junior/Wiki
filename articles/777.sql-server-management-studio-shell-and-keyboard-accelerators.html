<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva;">SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) plays important role to connect/manage the&nbsp;database estate without having&nbsp;difficulty, also there are few goodies (hidden gems) &nbsp;that you can simply enable on your Management Studio
 that will make your day-to-day usage life much better!</span></p>

<div class="content-fragment page no-wrapper" id="fragment-6615">
<div class="contentpan style="font-family:verdana,geneva;">Going on the topic of accelerator BOL defines clearly that it
<em>allows you to select a menu command or button by pressing ALT&#43;&lt;single letter&gt;</em>. For instance once you have opened SSMS&nbsp; to goto&nbsp;
<strong>Edit</strong> menu, press <em>ALT&#43;E</em>. Similarly you can rearrange and modify toolbar buttons, menus, and menu commands by using the
<strong>Customize</strong> dialog box. Instructions are provided for changing the settings using the mouse and using only the keyboard.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva;">Further customization can be enabled for stored procedures with Ctrl key, it can be created from the
<strong>Keyboard</strong> page of the <strong>Tools</strong>/<strong>Options</strong> dialog box. Similarly SSMS&nbsp; offers users two keyboard schemes. By default, it uses the Standard scheme, with keyboard shortcuts based on Visual Studio. Another scheme is used
 for&nbsp; SQL Server 2000 version, which can closely resembles the tools from SQL Server 2000, in particular the keyboard shortcuts from the Query Analyzer to manage your 2000 version estate. I have seen in few cases where SQL 2005/2008 database has been kept as
 backward compatibility as 2000 then SQL Server Management Studio cannot offer the keyboard shortcuts from Query Analyzer. So to avoid any disturbance you can&nbsp;change the keyboard scheme or add additional keyboard shortcuts, on the
<strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Options</strong>. Select the desired keyboard scheme on the
<strong>Environment</strong>, <strong>Keyboard</strong> page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva;">Coming back to Shell based tips, you can easily customize the toolbar through SSMS --&gt; Tools --&gt; Customize or just right-click on toolbar to choose the Customize command. Here is a good tip you need to separate Debug/Stop/Parse
 buttons towards other end that will reduce any confusion or accidental click to execute a script or SP/View within the SSMS query editor. Not only that if you are totally addicted to old Query Analyzer based icons, then simply take commands like Edit.SelectAll,
 and Edit.Delete and drag them on to the toolbar to duplicate the old Query Analyzer Erase button. Finally to show the toolbar tips and dynamic help for commands based on keywords the cursor is on use Dynamic Help command (CTRL&#43;ALT&#43;F4 which is standard SSMS
 2005 onwards)&nbsp; for SQL 2000 you can use same one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva;">Take your time to review Books ONline (updated)&nbsp; to go through Keyboard shortcuts for SQL Server Management Studio, that will make your life easier and shortcuts to work efficiency.</span></p>
