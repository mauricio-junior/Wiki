</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:calibri;">If all of your mailboxes are using Office 365, then the following information describes changes that Administrators and Users will experience during the EHA Migration:
</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:calibri;"><strong>Licensing:</strong> Your Office 365 licenses may be upgraded. Migrating EHA to Office 365 requires enabling the Advanced Archiving features in Office 365 which is available in Exchange
 Online Plan 2 (EP2). For more information about licensing grants for existing EHA customers please read
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/6262.eha-to-office-365-understand-your-licensing-options.aspx" target="_self">
EHA-to-Office 365: Understnading your Licensing Options</a>.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:calibri;"><strong>Impact of EHA migration on your Office 365 Global Address List (GAL):</strong> If a&nbsp;mailbox does not already exist in Exchange Online, one will be created for each provisioned EHA user
 that transitions from EHA. Each of these users will be appear in the GAL. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:calibri;"><strong>Unprovisioned Users:</strong> Before your transition you should review your EHA user list and make sure all users you expect to be in EHA exist. See the information on the Unprovisioned
 Users page located </span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/11568.un-provisioned-users.aspx"><span style="font-family:calibri;color:#0066dd;">here</span></a><span style="font-family:calibri;"> which discusses EHA Unprovisioned
 Users. </span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:calibri;"><strong>User Experience:
</strong>Existing Office 365 users will experience minimal impact during the migration of EHA. Your Office 365 users who have not had their Office 365 Archive folders enabled will now be archive enabled which means the user will see their Archive folders in
 their Outlook folder list. Also, the EHA messaging content will begin to appear in their Office 365 Archive folders as messages are migrated from EHA to Office 365. This migration does not impact the Inbox and folders in the user’s primary Office 365 mailbox.
</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:calibri;"><strong>Administration</strong>: Administrators will see that migration has made two configuration changes to their EHA-migrated Office 365 users – assuming that these settings were not already
 configured: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family:calibri;">The Archive Folders in the user’s Office 365 mailbox will become enabled. This is where migrated EHA messages will be placed.</span>
</li><li><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:11pt;font-family:calibri,sans-serif;">Litigation Hold will be enabled, which is the configuration that is equivalent with EHA’s Retention Period. Please visit the Message Retention and Legal/Litigation Hold page
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/11569.message-retention-and-legallitigation-hold.aspx">
<span style="color:#0066dd;">here</span></a> for additional information about how EHA’s Message Retention setting is equivalent to Office 365’s Litigation Hold setting.
