<div cltant"></a>Symptom: Action Center notification Check your backup (important)</h2>
<p>After updating a computer running Windows 7 or Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 a red cross&nbsp;is displayed in the&nbsp;Action Center icon on the taskbar&nbsp;an notifies you&nbsp;to &#39;Check your backup (important)&#39;. However, clicking on the icon does not provide any further information.&nbsp;Clicking
 the&nbsp;<strong>Open action center</strong> link instead also does not provide the ability to dismiss the message or provide further information.</p>
<h2><a name="Cause"></a>Cause:</h2>
<p>The Windows event logs contained notifications of Windows Backup event&nbsp;failure that&nbsp;were present on the computer when it was updated and these event logs are causing the alerts.
</p>
<h2><a name="Resolution_Work_Around_Recommendation"></a>Resolution/Work Around/Recommendation</h2>
<p>In Windows 8.1 the File Backup and Restore feature has been removed and has been replaced by the File History feature.
</p>
<p><span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable the messages from action center, go to the Action Center (by clicking Control Panel | System and Security | Action Center) and select to change Action Center Settings and uncheck Windows Backup.</p>
<p><span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows Backup will not be providing any new event messages for Windows 8.1 log files so suppressing these notification will not cause you to miss any important information. You can also delete the messages in the event log before updating your computer
 to prevent the notification from occurring. <br />
