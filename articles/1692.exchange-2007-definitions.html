<p>This page will list definitions of common terms used&nbsp;within and about&nbsp;Exchange 2007.
</p>
<p><strong>Availability Service</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;web service that is responsible for providing free/busy information to the Outlook 2007 client and Outlook Web Access 2007 and is available as a public web service to allow third-parties to&nbsp;develop tools to integrate with it.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Client Access Server Role&nbsp;(CAS)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This role enables mailbox access through Outlook Web Access, POP3, IMAP4, Outlook Anywhere (formerly known as remote procedure call [RPC] over HTTP),v></div><div class="content-fragment-content">

<div and Exchange Server ActiveSync.&nbsp; This role is similar in function to an Exchange 2000/2003 front-end but
 not in operation.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p><strong>Cluster Continuous&nbsp;Replication (CCR)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A Exchange 2007 clustering technique that leverages MSCS however has no requirement of shared disk.&nbsp; To do this it is built on a Windows failover

Majority Node Set (MNS)</a> cluster and &quot;log ships&quot; the transaction logs to the passive node.&nbsp; The passive node then applies these logs to its copy of the database.&nbsp; A seven part blogcast about&nbsp;CCR can be started

here</a> </li></ul>
<p><strong>cmdlet</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The smallest unit of a PowerShell command.&nbsp; There are over 360 cmdlets that will ship with Exchange 2007.&nbsp; These are usually simple task based commands such as &quot;move-mailbox&quot; or &quot;new-mailbox&quot;.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Edge Transport Role (Edge)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This&nbsp;role provides antivirus and anti-spam protection for the Exchange organization at the perimeter of the network.&nbsp; The Edge role does not rely on Active Directory rather it uses
<a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/29fb059e-544c-4577-bf7c-ba4b08df48431033.mspx?mfr=true">
ADAM</a> to provide configuration information. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Exchange 12</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange 12 is the internal code name for Exchange 2007. So if you see Exchange 12 referenced, you can assume that the correct name is Exchange Server 2007.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;A technology created to allow for mobile devices to synchronize with an Exchange mailbox.&nbsp; Windows Mobile devices as well as some non-Microsoft devices are able to leverage this technology.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Exchange Management Console (&quot;the console&quot;)&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is the Graphical MMC based console for administering Exchange, Mailboxes, contacts and distribution lists.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Exchange Management Shell (EMS, or &quot;the shell&quot;)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This is the command line interface that uses the PowerShell technology to administer Exchange, Mailboxes, contacts and distribution lists.&nbsp;At RTM EMS will actually have more&nbsp;abilities than does the Exchange console, however many of these tasks not exposed
 in the console are not commonly used. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Hub Transport Role (Hub)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This role (formerly referred to as &quot;bridgehead&quot;) handles internal transport and routing and is tightly integrated with Active Directory directory services. The Hub Transport role can also apply policies to messages to enforce compliance requirements.&nbsp; Unlike
 Exchange 2000/2003 the Hub transport does not rely on the IIS SMTP service to function.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Local Continuous Replication (LCR)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>An Exchange 2007 high-availability option that replicates a local storage group to another location on the same server.&nbsp; The intent is that this replication would be done to a second&nbsp;locally attached&nbsp;disk subsystem so that if a failure on the primary disk&nbsp;were
 to happen an administrator could manually mount the second copy of the storage group to restore service.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Mailbox Role</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This server role is responsible for hosting mailbox databases. A mailbox database contains users&#39; e-mail, calendar, contact, and task data.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Managed Folders</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Folders used in the Messaging Records Management (MRM) feature of Exchange Server 2007. MRM allows rention policies to be set on folder in user mailboxes.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Monad</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Monad&quot; is the codename for the scripting environment now known as PowerShell.&nbsp; (See PowerShell)
</li></ul>
<p><strong>One liner</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A group of PowerShell&nbsp;commands that&nbsp;pipeline information to each other to accomplish a single task (please fix me!)&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Outlook Anywhere (formerly RPC/HTTP)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A technology that&nbsp;encapsulates RPC communications within&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;calls.&nbsp; This allows for the use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Outlook through the internet without opening&nbsp;all of the required RPC ports.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Outlook Web Access (OWA)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A web interface for access an Exchange mailbox.&nbsp; This interface can view email, calendar, voice mail, and faxes.&nbsp; It also provides an interface for managing Windows Mobile devices using Exchange ActiveSync.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Outlook Voice Access (OVA)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A phone interface for an Exchange mailbox. This will allow a user to call in to get his mailbox items read.&nbsp; These mailbox items include voice mail, email, calendar appointments.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Performant</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Many people like to use this word when discussing how efficient&nbsp;Exchange Server 2007&nbsp;is, however this is
<a href="http://boulter.com/blog/2004/08/19/performant-is-not-a-word/" target="_blank">
not a real English word</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;:) </li></ul>
<p><strong>PowerShell</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Formerly known as codename &quot;Monad&quot;, this is the command line shell used to administer Exchange, and is the foundation for the new generation of scripting capabilities that can be added to Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows XP.&nbsp; Currently available
 as a free download, future versions of Microsoft Operating Systems will include PowerShell.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Roles</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Server roles&nbsp;allow for each of the discrete functions of Exchange to be broken out into multiple services and thus servers.&nbsp; However a single server can run four of the roles (Mailbox, Client Access, Hub Transport, and UM)&nbsp;at once though this is only advisable
 in smaller scenarios.&nbsp; The roles are Hub Transport, Client Access, Edge Transport, Mailbox, and Unified Messaging.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Single Copy Cluster (SCC)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This type of clustering&nbsp;is&nbsp;the traditional&nbsp;Exchange clustering method.&nbsp; It requires a MSCS cluster and shared storage.&nbsp;It has support for&nbsp;up to eight nodes&nbsp;with Windows 2003 Enterprise and requires at least one passive node.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standby Continuous Replication (SCR)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A new continuous replication option available&nbsp;in Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1. This allows copies of the database to be kept on other Exchange servers or clusters for recovery. This sort of replication can work between datacenters.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>UM</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Short for Unified Messaging.&nbsp; Exchange 2007 adds the ability to integrate Voice Mail and Email into a single place.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows for t
 in smaller scenarios.&nbsp; The roles are Hub Transport, Client Access, Edge Transport, Mailbox, and Unified Messaging.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Single Copy Cluster (SCC)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This type of clustering&nbsp;is&nbsp;the traditional&nbsp;Exchange clustering method.&nbsp; It requires a MSCS cluster and shared storage.&nbsp;It has support for&nbsp;up to eight nodes&nbsp;with Windows 2003 Enterprise and requires at least one passive node.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standby Continuous Replication (SCR)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A new continuous replication option available&nbsp;in Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1. This allows celephone users (OVA),&nbsp; Web&nbsp;users (OWA)&nbsp;and MAPI users&nbsp;to access both email and voice mail.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Unified Messaging Role</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This server role enables users to receive voice mail, e-mail, fax messages, and calendar information in their Exchange inbox; voice access to the inbox from any phone; and speech-enabled Automated Attendant functionality that allow callers to interact through
 touch tone menus or their voice using speech recognition. </li></ul>
<p><strong>WebReady Document Viewing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>This is a feature of Outlook Web Access that will render Office 2003 (and previous) and Adobe Acrobat files in HTML for viewing on clients that do not have the appropriate viewers installed.&nbsp; This is an excellent feature for kiosk access to Outlook Web
 Access. </li></ul>
