<p>Before Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 can crawl any content sources, you must provide the e-mail address of a contact person in your organization. This enables an external administrator to contact you in case a crawl is contributing to a problem
 such as performance degradation on a server that you are crawling.</p>
<p>The administrator of a server that you crawl can find the contact e-mail address in the server event logs. For example, if Office SharePoint Server 2007 is crawling Web-based content, the contact e-mail address appears in the Internet Information Services
 (IIS) logs on the crawled server.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must be a farm administrator to complete this procedure.</p>
