The Content Pipeline&nbsp;is a special set of assemblies included with XNA Game Studio&nbsp;that use MSBuild to compile game assets such as image&nbsp;and sound files into streamlined, pre-processed&nbsp;binary files called XNBs (so named for the fact that the&nbsp;file extension of
 the compiled version of&nbsp;a source file&nbsp;is changed to .xnb) which load quickly at run-time. The&nbsp;Content Pipeline&nbsp;is only available on Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;For XNA 4.0 it&nbsp;requires the full&nbsp;.NET Framework 4.0. Previous versions of the Content Pipeline require the full&nbsp;.NET
 Framework 2.0. The Content Pipeline requires the&nbsp;full .NET Framework due its use of MSBuild.<br />
<br />
XNB files are platform-specific and are designed to be loaded using the XNA Framework&#39;s ContentManager class and related internal helper&nbsp;classes&nbsp;without the Content Pipeline assemblies. As such, content built with the XNA Content Pipeline can be used at run-time
 despite the fact that the Content Pipeline might not exist on the target platform. The Content Pipeline is not included with the XNA Framework Redistributable and the XNA Framework EULA prohibits the distribution of the Content Pipeline assemblies except as
 packaged with XNA Game Studio.<br />
<br />
The Content Pipeline is invoked through a special project type called a &quot;content project&quot;. Game assets are added to the content project which is then referenced by one or more XNA game projects (XNA game projects are slightly customized .csproj files). The
 same content project can be shared by game projects targeting different platforms provided they are all targeting the same version of the XNA Framework. When built, assets in&nbsp;the content project will be&nbsp;compiled and written out to XNB files&nbsp;that are appropriate
 for&nbsp;the target platform of each&nbsp;game project which the content project is referenced by.&nbsp;This is one of many features of the XNA Framework that ease&nbsp;cross-platform development.<br />
<br />
The Content Pipeline&nbsp;includes content importers and processors for many popular content creation tool&nbsp;export formats&nbsp;. Also, the Content Pipeline is fully extensible. This allows you to&nbsp;develop content importers and processors for any other file formats that
 your content tools export to&nbsp;provided that you have the specifications for the format and are not prohibited from doing so&nbsp;due to any&nbsp;legal considerations such as intellectual property rights and licensing agreements.</p>
<h2><a name="How_It_Works"></a>How It Works</h2>
<p>The Content Pipeline operates as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The .contentproj file is read to find the next asset (if any) along with its specified importer and processor. (n.b. All importers inherit from ContentImporter&lt;T&gt;. All processors inherit from ContentProcessor&lt;TInput,TOutput&gt;.)
</li><li>An instance of the specified importer is created. </li><li>The&nbsp;importer&#39;s Import method is called passing in the file name of the asset along with a ContentImporterContent (which provides a mechanism for returning warning and error messages). The asset specified by the file name&nbsp;is read&nbsp;either directly into the
 output&nbsp;object or else (if processing must be done to transform it into the output format)&nbsp;into an intermediate object of another type which will later be used to create the output object which Import returns.
</li><li>The Import method does minimal processing in order to determine if any other assets must be read in (e.g. texture maps and custom effects&nbsp;for a 3D model). If so it reads in each of the other assets (either directly or by creating an instance of&nbsp;the appropriate&nbsp;processor
 for that&nbsp;asset type&nbsp;and calling its Import method) and assigns them to the appropriate fields and properties within the intermediate object or the output object.
</li><li>Upon completion the Import method populates the output&nbsp;object from any intermediate objects if necessary and then&nbsp;returns the output object, which is fully loaded from the file system&nbsp;and ready for processing.
</li><li>An instance of the specified processor is created and its Process method is called, passing in as the input object&nbsp;the object that was returned from the importer&#39;s Import method along with an instance of the&nbsp;default implementation of the&nbsp;ContentProcessorContext
 abstract class. </li><li>The Process method does whatever processing is required on the input object including creating a new instance of the output object and populating it appropriately&nbsp;if the type of the output object differs from the type of the input object.
</li><li>The Process method returns the output object. </li><li>An instance of the ContentTypeWriter&lt;T&gt; for the type of the object returned from Process is instantiated and passed the object returned from Process along with a ContentWriter instance that is setup to write to the appropriate output file for the asset.
 ContentWriter is derived from BinaryWriter and includes methods for writing several XNA Framework value types and&nbsp;a few types that act to reference other assets. It also includes functionality for applying a general-purpose, lossless&nbsp;compression algorithm
 to&nbsp;the output depending on the platform and whether or not any meaningful amount of&nbsp;compression could be achieved. (n.b. Compression is never applied in Debug configuration, only in Release configuration.)
</li><li>The ContentTypeWriter&lt;T&gt; writes out the object in a target platform-appropriate way&nbsp;along with metadata indicating what the appropriate ContentTypeReader to read the object in at run-time is and what the run-time type of the object that is being written
 out should be. The build-time and run-time types&nbsp;sometimes differ due to how certain things must be addressed during build-time in order to avoid things like circular references and inappropriate dependence on the characteristics of the build-time platform.
</li><li>At run-time, when a request is made to an instance of the ContentManager class to load a specific XNB file using its Load&lt;T&gt; method, the ContentManager examines the file, checks to purpose, lossless&nbsp;compression algorithm
 to&nbsp;the output depending on the platform and whether or not any meaningful amount of&nbsp;compression could be achieved. (n.b. Compression is never applied in Debug configuration, only in Release configuration.)
</li><li>The ContentTypeWriter&lt;T&gt; writes out the object in a target platform-appropriate way&nbsp;along with metadata indicating what the appropriate ContentTypeReader to read the object in at run-time is and what the run-time type of the object that is being written
 out should be. The build-time and run-time types&nbsp;sometmake sure the&nbsp;metadata specifying the run-time type matches the type T that
 was&nbsp;specified and then locates the&nbsp;ContentTypeReader that the metadata specifies and reads the file in, returning a reference to the object it has loaded while caching a reference internally to avoid loading the same asset multiple times and to speed subsequent
 requests (if any) for the same asset. This reference&nbsp;also enables the ContentManager to&nbsp;call Dispose on any objects it has loaded which implement IDisposable when the ContentManager&#39;s Unload method is called in order to prevent memory leaks from occurring.
