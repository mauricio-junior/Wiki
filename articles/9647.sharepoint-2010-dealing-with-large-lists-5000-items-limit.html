<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

If you need to handle a large amount of data, this article will be very handful.<br />
<br />
First thing to keep in mind is the SharePoint Boundaries and Limits (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787.aspx</a>) and this article Designing large lists and maximizing list
 performance <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262813.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262813.aspx</a>.<br />
<br />
According to SharePoint Boundaries and Limits, it&#39;s supported 30,000,000 items per list. That&#39;s a lot of information.
<br />
<br />
So, <strong>Why the 5,000 items limit?<br />
</strong><br />
That happens because the SQL Server limit of row locks. When you try to perform a operation to up 5,000 items, it&#39;s easier to SQL to do a Lock Scalation and temporary lock the entire table. When this happens very often, the users will experience a performance
 degradation. (For more info, see: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-foundation-help/manage-lists-and-libraries-with-many-items-HA010377496.aspx">
