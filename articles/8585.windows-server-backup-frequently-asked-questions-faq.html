<h2><a name="ADCSForum">Does Windows Server Backup support backing up remote servers?</a></h2>
<br />
Currently, Windows Server Backup can only backup the local server on which it is installed. But you can remotely connect to a server with Windows Server Backup UI and then manage Windows Server Backup remotely on that server. In this scenario, you must first
 install Windows Server Backup feature on the remote computer. If you are looking at backing up multiple servers, you can consider

<h2><a name="ADCSForum">Reasons which may cause the backup to be full instead of incremental</a></h2>
<p>In Windows Server 2008 R2 , there are several reasons which may cause the backup to be full instead of incremental:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup on the target is deleted/not present. </li><li>Source volume snapshot is deleted, from which the last backup was taken. </li><li>14 incremental backups have occurred since the last full backup </li><li>More than 14 days have passed since the last full backup </li></ol>
<ul>
<li>This is to avoid the possibility of a disk corruption affecting the integrity of a backup; if you wrote the changes only to the VHD, it is quite possible that, over time, blocks on the disk might become corrupt, which would not be noticed by the backup
 application if the content had not changed. By writing a full backup each two weeks, the WSB can make sure all blocks are still functional and that your backup can be restored when you need it.
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Churn on the backup source is high (more than 50%) </li></ol>

<h2><a name="Compatibility_Issues_between_Windows_Server_Backup_and_NTBackup_Utility"></a>Compatibility Issues between Windows Server Backup and NTBackup Utility</h2>
<p>The first change that many administrators notice is that NTBackup is no longer called NTBackup, but rather Windows Server Backup. The new name is far from being the most important change though.<br />
<br />
From an administrator’s standpoint, the most important change that you need to be aware of is that Windows Server Backup is not compatible with backups that you have made using NTBackup. If you use NTBackup to back your data up to an external hard drive or
 to a network drive, then the data is encapsulated within a .BKF file. Although Microsoft has used the .BKF format for many years now, they have discontinued support for it in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2.<br />
<br />
All is not lost though. If you have data that is backed up in .BKF format, you can restore that data to a Windows 2008 server. You just cannot do it natively. Instead, you will have to download
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7da725e2-8b69-4c65-afa3-2a53107d54a7&amp;DisplayLang=en">
Microsoft’s Windows NT Backup – Restore Utilit</a>y. This utility will not allow you to create backups in .BKF format, but it will allow you to restore your data.<br />
<br />
That is the good news. The bad news is that unlike its predecessors, Windows Server Backup does not offer support for tape drives. Therefore if you have been using NTBackup to write data to tape backup, then you are going to want to leave at least one Windows
 2003 server on your network so that you can retrieve the data off of your backup tapes should the need arise.<br />
