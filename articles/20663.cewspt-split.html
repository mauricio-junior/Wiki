This stage can be used to convert a string based single value Managed Property to&nbsp;a multi-value&nbsp;Managed property. After your Matcher stage the output is usually a&nbsp;semi-colon based string. In case you need the output as a Multi-Value Managed property&nbsp;use the
 Split Stage to accept the semi-colon&nbsp;based property ( output of previous stage ) as Input. The output Managed Property of Split will then contain a Multi-value managed property.&nbsp;&nbsp;
