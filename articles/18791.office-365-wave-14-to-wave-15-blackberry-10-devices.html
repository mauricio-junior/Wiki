<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

<span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:13px;">I have posted additional articles here and or in the Office 365 Forums regarding pre-upgrades procedures that MS has made to some of my customers tenants that have changed behaviour. Now, MS has stated repeatly
 that they haven&#39;t changed anything even though some of these changes are graphically visual as well as behavior changes.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;So, I wanted to adv>
<div class="content-fragment page no-wrapper" id="fragment-6615">
<div class="content-fragment-inner fiji-content-fragment-inner"><div class="content-fragment-top fiji-content-fragment-top"><div class="r1 fiji-r1"></div><div class="r2 fiji-r2"></div><div class="r3 fiji-r3"></div><div class="r4 fiji-r4"></div></divd another for BlackBerry 10 Devices. These devices &nbsp;are not currently supported for BB Cloud Services - so RIM will tell one to use Active Sync. The problem with that inline with my above comments is that they suggest using m.outlook.com
 or searching for the server settings in OWA. But for customers that seem to be in the state I mention above neither work. To get it configured one must actually use the POP settings for a Wave 15 tenant which would be outlook.office365.com.<br />
<br />
I thought this would be useful and I&nbsp; have also written to BB Support (RIM) that they should also add this to their guidance. Because, if you write to them questioning about&nbsp; the setup with BB 10 Devices they&#39;ll send you this link:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/KB33522"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#0000ff;">http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/KB33522</span></a><br />
I will also post&nbsp;in the Office 365 &nbsp;forum - so others don&#39;t waste some of the time I did &amp; finally got it to work on a last ditch effort.
