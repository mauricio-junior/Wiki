<p>When you install Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 or install Microsoft Exchange server 2010 on a global catalog server, Exchange Server services cannot start. However, you can start other services manually. Servers in this configuration may take a long time
 to shut down. Additionally, the following events are logged: </p>

Source: MSExchangeIS <br />
Category: General <br />
Type: Error <br />
Description: Unable to initialize the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service. - Error 0x96e.
</p>
<p>Cause :<br />
----------<br />
This problem occurs because the domain controller and other Exchange-Server-dependent services do not start completely when Exchange Server 2007 or Exchange Server 2010 try to start.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution :<br />
------------<br />
--The solution which was worked for me was :<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:14px;">Set all the Exchange failing services to &quot;Automatic (Delayed Start)&quot; and reboot the server .<br />
</span><br />
Make sure after setting the <strong>services to &quot;Automatic (Delayed Start)&quot; </strong>
the services are not starting automatically after reboot.<br />
<br />
</strong><span class="pBody postableBody">Automatic (Delayed Start) delays the startup of a service approximately 2 min. after the system has completed starting the operating system.<br />
