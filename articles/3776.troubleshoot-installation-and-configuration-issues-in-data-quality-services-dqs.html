DQSInstaller.exe file or the </span>Data Quality Server Installer option in the Start Menu&nbsp;</a>
</h1>
<p>The <strong>Data Quality Server Installer</strong> option in the <strong>Start</strong> menu or the DQSInstaller.exe file is available at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.<em>&lt;instance_name&gt;</em>\MSSQL\Binn
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> if you selected the <strong>Data Quality Services</strong> check box under
<strong>Database Engine Services</strong> on the Feature Selection page while installing SQL Server 2012.
<br />
<br />
To fix the issue, run the SQL Server setup again, and add the DQS server to the existing SQL Server instance by selecting the
<strong>Data Quality Services</strong> check box on the Feature Selection page. For more information about adding a feature to an existing SQL Server instance, see
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc281940(SQL.110).aspx">Add Features to an Instance of SQL Server 2012 (Setup)</a>.<br />

<h1><a name="MultipleInstancesIcon">When multiple instances are installed, the Start menu&nbsp;item for running DQSInstaller works only for&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;instance</a></h1>
<p>The item to run DQSInstaller in the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> menu (<strong>Data Quality Services</strong> &gt;
<strong>Data Quality Server Installer</strong>)&nbsp;points to the last instance of DQS installed when multiple instances of SQL Server Engine and Data Quality Services&nbsp;are installed in sequence. Since DQS is installed per instance, you must run the DQSInstaller
 once for each instance separately if you wish to use DQS with each instance.<br />
<br />
The workaround is to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the command prompt window as&nbsp;an administrator. </li><li>Change directory to the program files folder for the instance of DQS which you&nbsp;want to install. For example:<br />
<span style="font-size:11px;font-family:&#39;courier new&#39;;">cd &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.&lt;<em>InstanceName</em>&gt;\MSSQL\Binn\&quot;</span>
</li><li>Run the DQSInstaller.exe to completion. </li></ol>

<h1><a name="ErrorReinstallingDQS">Error on reinstalling Data Quality Server</a></h1>
<p>When you run the DQSInstaller.exe file to reis to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the command prompt window as&nbsp;an administrator. </li><li>Change directory to the program files folder for the instance of DQS which you&nbsp;wantnstall&nbsp;Data Quality Server&nbsp;on a SQL Server instance on a computer where it was previously installed, you might receive the following error:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:11px;font-family:&#39;courier new&#39;;">“Cannot create file ‘C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.\MSSQL\DATA\DQS_MAIN.mdf&#39; because it already exists.”</span></p>
<p>This occurs because DQS databases (DQS_MAIN and DQS_PROJECTS) from the previous DQS server installation are still present on your computer even after you uninstalled DQS server. When you uninstall DQS server or a SQL Server instance containing DQS server,
 some DQS objects are not removed from the computer. You must manually delete those DQS objects after uninstalling DQS server or a SQL Server instance containing DQS server. To fix this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit the currently active DQS server installation by closing the DQSInstaller.exe window.
</li><li>Manually delete the existing DQS objects from previous installation. For more information about removing DQS objects, see
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh231667(SQL.110).aspx">Remove Data Quality Services Objects</a>.
</li><li>Run the DQSInstaller.exe file&nbsp;to reinstall DQS. For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh231682(SQL.110).aspx">

<h1><a name="ErrorSPProcOption"><span style="color:#0066dd;">Error: Could not find stored procedure &#39;SP_PROCOPTION&#39;. Dqs could not be installed</span></a></h1>
<p>When you run the DQSInstaller.exe file to complete the DQS server installation, you might receive the following error:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:11px;font-family:&#39;courier new&#39;;">“Could not find stored procedure &#39;SP_PROCOPTION&#39;. Dqs could not be installed.”</span></p>
<p>This occurs because some accent-sensitive server collation (for example, Turkish_CI_AS)&nbsp;is set on the SQL Server instance where you are installing Data Quality Server, and DQS does not support it. If you require accent-sensitive server collation for your
 SQL Server instance, you must install&nbsp;Data Quality Server&nbsp;in another SQL Server instance that has accent-insensitive server collation. For more information about collations in SQL Server, see

<h1><a name="Assembly_Warning">Warning: The Microsoft .NET Framework assembly you are registering is not fully tested in SQL Server hosted environment.</a></h1>
<p>When you run the DQSInstaller.exe to complete the DQS server installation, you will receive the following warnings in the console output and in the DQSInstaller.log<br />
<br />
DQS has dependencies on system assemblies, like System.Web. Any references to outside assemblies are considered Unsafe in SQL CLR, so it prints the warning for each one that DQS registers. DQS uses SQL CLR procedures to run .Net code inside the host process
 SQLServr.exe.</p>
<p>In this case they are all Microsoft assemblies, and are tested by the DQS team, so we can ignore the warnings.</p>
<p>SQL CLR’s restrictions cause this, and SQL CLR doesn’t have any switch to turn it off the warnings.

<h1><a name="AccentedTMPfolder">Error&nbsp;when special character or accented character appears in TMP environment variable&nbsp;folder</a>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>When you run the DQSInstaller.exe to complete the installation of Data Quality Services in SQL Server 2012 RTM, the installation will fail if the TMP folder contains accented characters. This is common in non-english Windows account user names such as
<strong>Accénted </strong>since the user profile and default Temp folder is located in a path with special characters by Windows itself.<br />
<br />

<p>To resolve the situation where the user name has an accented character, please override the TMP environment variable temporarily in the command prompt session to run the DQSInstaller. Make a directory or use an existing directory, such as c:\temp, and set
 the TMP environment variable to point to that directory, then run DQSInstaller.exe from the same command prompt to set the local TMP variable to override the environment TMP variable. In this example MSSQLServer is the default instance of SQL Server, but the
 instance name may vary.<br />
<br />
Launch the command prompt as elevated administrator if on a UAC protected operating system. Start &gt; cmd.exe &gt; right click and Run as Administrator. Then run the following kind of command to begin DQSInstaller.exe, and follow the prompts to continue.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">When you run the DQSInstaller.exe file to install Data Quality Server you might receive the following error:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;courier new&#39;;font-size:13px;">&quot;Msg 15240, Level 16, State 2, Server SQL01\MSSQLSERVER, Line 1<br />
Cannot write into file &#39;dqs_certificate.cer&#39;. Verify that you have write permissions, that the file path is valid, and that the file does not already exist.&quot;</span></p>
<p>This occurs because there is already a file in the default DATA directory named dqs_certificate.cer from a previous failed installation or after you uninstalled DQS server. When you uninstall DQS server or a SQL Server instance containing DQS server, some
 DQS objects are not removed from the computer. You must manually delete this file&nbsp;after uninstalling DQS server or a SQL Server instance containing DQS server. To fix this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit the currently active DQS server installation by closing the DQSInstaller.exe window.
</li><li>Manually delete the existing&nbsp;dqs_certificate.cer file from the default DATA directory (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA). For more information about removing DQS objects, see
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh231667(SQL.110).aspx"><span style="color:#0066dd;">Remove Data Quality Services Objects</span></a>.
</li><li>Run the DQSInstaller.exe file&nbsp;to reinstall DQS. For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh231682(SQL.110).aspx">
<span style="color:#0066dd;">Run DQSInstaller.exe to Complete Data Quality&nbsp;Server Installation</span></a>.

<p>This issue is corrected in Service Pack 1 for SQL Server 2012.</p>
