<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

<br />
<p>When deploying Workflows within Workflow Manager as long activities inside of trusted surface are used, there is no assembly which should be referenced or published to the host.
<br />
All required is contained in a XAML. <br />
<br />
Usually one workflow is WorkflowDefinition which basically defines the activation envelope of the aji-r2"></div><div class="r3 fiji-r3"></div><div class="r4 fiji-r4"></div></div></div></div>
<div class="content-fragment page no-wrapper" id="fragment-6615">
<div class="content-fragment-inner fiji-content-fragment-inner"><div class="content-fragment-top fiji-content-fragment-top"><div class="r1 fiji-r1"></div><div class="r2 fround the activity.
<br />
That means one workflow is defined by two XAML-s: Activit.Xaml and Workflow.Xaml.
<br />
Activity.Xaml fully implements the workflow in XAML. Workflow.Xaml defines configuration, activation, etc. and sets the reference to Activity.xaml which will be executed.
</p>
<p>So, Deployment is two-phase process: <br />
<br />
client.Activities.Publish(Activity.Xaml) and</p>
<p>client.Workflows.Publish(Workflow.Xaml); </p>
<p>As we see, first root activity is published to the manager database and then the workflow envelope (workflow description) itself. This is because, Workflow has a dependency to root activity, so activity has to be deployed first.
<br />
As long you use built-in activities defined by <a href="http://developers.de/blogs/damir_dobric/archive/2012/09/16/workflow-trusted-surface.aspx">
trusted surface </a>there is no need for any assembly to be deployed. All you have and need is declarative XAML.
<br />
However in a case of extending of trusted surface, fist assemblies which implement custom types have to be deployed. After they are deployed, workflow publishing works as already described above.</p>
<p>To get a feeling about publishing open the browser and paste following:</p>
<p>GET //<span style="text-decoration:underline;">SharePoint/default/eac2871d-0758-4a2e-8b03-c02598c63c0b/8256fccd-21e8-4435-8327-2affb3234c23/</span>$Workflows?$skip=0&amp;$top=100</p>
<p>Note, the underlined part is the scope path of workflow at your machine (this one is example from my machine). This statement is a REST call to Workflow Manager which will return up to 100 installed workflow definitions.
<br />
Similarly following REST call would get the full Workflow Description of workflow with name=’ d1991cf0-0fa3-46d7-9cf7-32014141c6aa‘:</p>
<p>GET //SharePoint/default/eac2871d-0758-4a2e-8b03-c02598c63c0b/8256fccd-21e8-4435-8327-2affb3234c23/$Workflows/d1991cf0-0fa3-46d7-9cf7-32014141c6aa
<br />
<br />
There is also a REST call which can dump-out the whole XAML implementation.</p>
