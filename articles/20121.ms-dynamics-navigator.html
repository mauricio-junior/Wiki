<p>Basically Navigator was an upgraded version of PC Plus, but on a significant point Navigator significantly separated from the previous program. For where PC Plus was a single-user solution PC &amp; C could as some of the first in the world with this version

(Navigator 2)<br />
<p>The difference between this version of Navigator, now known as Navision, and the previous versions was that there in this version was a built in development environment and that it had it&#39;s own development languages which PC &amp; C decided to call AL (application
 language).</p>
<p>This significant change made it possible for dealers to correct in almost all parts of the system and thereby customize the system to each customer&#39;s specific requirements. As a result, you could from now one see very sophisticated additional solutions released
 for Navision/Navigator , for example, wages and production management systems.</p>
<p>With these changes grew Navision/Navigator significantly on the market and was no longer reserved the very small solutions with 1 to 10 users, but had already at that time customers with over 100 user in their system.</p>
