<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Enabling rapid elasticity in the supply of private cloud resources to tenants impacts on many of the same operational security functions as the enabling of the on-demand self-service and resource pooling
 attributes discussed previously:</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:12px;">Role-based access controls must govern the requests for private-cloud resources. However, your private cloud may support automatic scaling, so the requests for resources may also come from the hosted applications themselves
 instead of from the tenant.</span> </li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">You should ensure that all requests for resources (and freeing of resources) are logged and auditable.</span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">You should ensure that tenant isolation and data protection is maintained as resources are allocated and de-allocated.</span>
</li></ul>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">However, enabling rapid elasticity in the supply of private cloud resources raises some additional operational concerns:</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:12px;">Allocating and de-allocating resources takes a finite amount of time. Too many allocation and de-allocation requests from a tenant or a tenant application could prevent requests from other tenants being fulfilled, or even destabilize
 the private cloud. Monitoring should detect and limit this type of behavior. Audit trails should identify the source of every request to allocate or de-allocate resources.</span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">Although one of the benefits of cloud architectures is to achieve a more efficient use of available resources by using resource pooling and recycling to average out demand, your monitoring should track overall resource utilization
 and trends to help you ensure you have enough capacity to maintain availability at peak times.</span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">Enabling rapid elasticity puts further pressure on the processes that clean the resources that tenants return to the pool before those resources can be re-used.
</span></li></ul>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Enabling rapid elasticity shares some of the same security concerns as managing resource pooling. However, in addition to the requirement that resources can be recycled without compromising the confidentiality
 of any data that a service might have stored on the resource before releasing it back into the pool, resource recycling must happen quickly, especially if there is pressure on the available resources within the cloud. This consideration further emphasizes
 the importance of efficient automation procedures to manage the cloud infrastructure.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Giving client business units or hosted applications the ability to rapidly scale in or out the virtual resources they are using also gives those clients access to the shared pool of resources. You
 must constrain elasticity in the supply of available resources so that clients do not affect the availability of the services owned and managed by other clients or destabilize the cloud as a whole.
</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">Monitoring and Logging</span></strong></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">You should monitor and log resource requests to maintain a full audit trail of provisioning requests associated with scaling running applications and services. This approach can help you to identify
 clients or applications that might be affecting the overall availability of services within the cloud by overloading the infrastructure with requests to provision or de-provision resources. You should also have automated monitoring in place that can identify
 resource de-provisioning requests that attempts to flood the cloud with requests to shut down running services within the cloud in a type of denial of service attack.</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">Managing Capacity Limits</span></strong></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Although in the private cloud there is typically a financial incentive for client business units to use resources efficiently, the private cloud approach to service delivery is new and may be unfamiliar
 to the service consumers. Although SLAs may offer guarantees that resources will be available to scale running applications and services, and that those resources will be available within a given timeframe, the CSP may need to take steps to educate tenants
 about the elastic capabilities of the private cloud. <br />

<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Part of the private cloud capacity management processes should include regular reviews of any resource usage quotas applied to tenants. Changes in usage patterns of private cloud resources and changes
 in the available resources may enable you to increase quotas or force you to reduce them.
</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">If you use quotas to control how many virtual instances a service or application can use, you may be able to use information from the provisioning system as input to your capacity planning procedures
 to ensure the availability of services in the longer term.</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">To manage capacity limits, you may consider a hybrid private cloud model that enables you to use a public cloud or a private cloud hosted by a third party to host applications and services when your
 on-premises capacity is exhausted in order to maintain availability (sometimes referred to as â€œcloud bursting). In this scenario, you must plan carefully how you will continue to provide your services to your client business units, including how you will:</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:12px;">Maintain the information security of tenant applications and services.</span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">Integrate identity and access management systems with the external cloud.</span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">Continue to meet the requirements specified in the SLAs with your client business units.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">Manage events, incidents, and problems.</span> </li><li><span style="font-size:12px;">Ensure IT service continuity.</span> </li></ul>

</h2>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Enabling rapid elasticity in the supply of resources may require the infrastructure to move virtualized services between physical devices (for example to load balance requests effectively). Automated
 procedures that move running services between physical servers should ensure that recycling resources does not accidentally expose confidential data.</span></p>

</h2>
<span style="font-size:12px;"></span>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Typically, enabling rapid elasticity in the supply of resources is achieved by allocating additional virtual machines to a tenant application or service and configuring load balancing across those
 virtual machines. Tenant applications will not always &quot;just work&quot; in such a scenario: they must be designed to work in this way, often by introducing state data that must be shared between the different instances. Sharing state may involve configuring access
 control on a cache, using shared data that must be protected, or using the client application. These approaches may introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;">You can provide best practice guidance or verification services to software development groups within the enterprise on the approaches they can take to ensure that application and services take reasonable
 steps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and trust-worthiness of their data when they are scaled to run on multiple instances.<br />
