<ul>
<li>If the historical data doesnâ€™t take up much space, leave it in the original list.
</li><li>Turn on versioning if you want to track the history of individual list items.
</li><li>If the history involves different records, leave them in the list and sort the view on the date of the history with the most recent at the top.
</li></ul>
<p>Finally, the most common option: eventually archive the items to a different site collection in a different content database if you need to save space.</p>
