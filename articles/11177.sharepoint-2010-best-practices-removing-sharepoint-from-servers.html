<p>This page discusses<strong> how to remove</strong> SharePoint from servers in the farm:<br />
<br />
1. <strong>Log in</strong> to each of the SharePoint servers in the farm </p>
<p>2. <strong>Run the SharePoint Configuration Wizard</strong> on each of the Web Front End servers and unjoin them from the farm. Provided no Web Apps were built outside of SharePoint&#39;s control, they should be automatically deprovisioned along with the web
 sites. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Run the SharePoint Configuration Wizard</strong> on the App server, and choose to remove it as the last server in the farm.
</p>
<p>4. Go into <strong>SQL Management Studio</strong> and remove the Configuration, Content, and Service Application Databases. Be sure to not delete other databases. Made them first read only for a few days, and if there are no&nbsp;errors, delete&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <strong>Rejoin</strong> servers and recreate the farm to your new specifications.<br />
