In the course of administering a transactional replication architecture a number of error conditions can occur. Some of these errors are related to synchronization and can be remedied via the issuance of a reinitialization command or stopping and starting the
 replication agents. Others are not so straightforward and require replication be dropped and recreated. Some still require the publisher database be recreated. This last case are more often the case of ghosts in replicid="fragment-6615">

<br />
These ghosts can occur when OS&nbsp;cluster nodes are out of synch at the block level and one node has an msdb synchronized prior to the removal of a database, or an msdb synchronized for the positive existence of database objects and not the negative, that is to
 say one way comparison. This is likely a left join of object sets from the active node to the passive node for creation, without the right join of sets for deletion. When the cluster fails over to passive node and the agent, or distributor entry&nbsp;comes into
 existence&nbsp;after the master has been updated to reflect the removal. <br />
