<tr>
<td>Approve Manual Agent Install</td>
<td>This is the most common item and it is normal to see this.&nbsp; This indicates a new client has contact MOM that was installed from WSUS/SCCM or even manually via command line.&nbsp; There is a MOM script that runs every hour :45 min after the hour that approves
 these clients creating an individual discovery rule for the client as well as moving the client into agent-managed computers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Install Agent</td>
<td>This is typically the norm in a non-FCS MOM environment. This typically appears because there is a Discovery Rule created for a system that does not currently exist in MOM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uninstall Agent</td>
<td>In an FCS MOM environment this typically means one of two things.&nbsp; Either the Discovery rule for that client is missing or the client does not exist in Active Directory any more.&nbsp; MOM discovery runs nightly and if the system has been pruned out of AD the
 client will be put into Pending Uninstall.</td>

<p><span style="font-size:small;"><strong>Discovery Rules</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">In FCS there should always be 1 discovery rule per system.&nbsp;

<p><span style="font-size:small;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">FCS does not use any wildcard rules or exclude rules.&nbsp; Rules for client machines follow the format as follows:</span></p>
