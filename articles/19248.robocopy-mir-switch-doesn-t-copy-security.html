<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

I used Robocopy with the /mir switch to copy data from a folder on one server to a folder on another but found I had to add the /copyall and /dcopy:T switches to get a true mirror of source, i.e including security setting and timestamps on folders. Interesting
 as I originally tried to copy using th /e switch along with /copyall but that failed to copy the security settings.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: use /mir /copyall /dcopy:T with Robocopy to get a true copy of source data to destination.
