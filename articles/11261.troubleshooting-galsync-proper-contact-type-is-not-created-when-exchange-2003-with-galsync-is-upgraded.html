<h1><a name="Synopsis"></a><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">Synopsis</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">I recently worked with a customer that had a “working” GALSync solution and wanted to able to share calendars between two forests.&nbsp; The customer noted, the users in the target domain were being created as “Mail Contacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">Upon further discussion with the customer we discovered that in Forest A calendar sharing was working.&nbsp; In Domain B, they were getting an error that Calendar Sharing was not available for the contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">As we investigated it came to light that the GALSync solution was created in an Exchange 2010 environment and calendar sharing was working very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">They acquired a company that had their own AD environment and an Exchange 2003 environment.&nbsp; GALSync was configured for the acquired domain, Domain B, and was creating mail contacts without error.&nbsp; Meanwhile the old Exchange
 2003 Environment was upgraded to Exchange 2010.&nbsp; When they tried to enable calendar sharing in Domain B for users in Domain A, they got an error that calendar sharing was not available for users from that domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">We noticed that in Domain B, the users were created as “Mail Contacts.”&nbsp; In domain A, they were being created as “Cross-forest Mail Contacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">After comparing the two agents using the </span>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=7969" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">MIIS 2003 Resource Kit</span></a><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"> tool “MA Configuration Viewer we saw that the upgraded
 2010 Exchange Environment GALSync MAs were missing an attribute that the working Exchange 2010 MAs had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">By looking at the attribute flows, I noticed that the agents configured for Domain A were flowing an attribute called:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;font-size:24px;">msExchRecipientDisplayType=&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>–1073741818</strong> </span></li><li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;font-size:24px;">msExchRecipientTypeDetails =&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>32768</strong> </span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">After modifying the acquired domains GALSync MA to include the above attributes and running through the following Run Profiles:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Delta Import on each Forest A MA</strong>
</span></li><li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Delta Sync on each Forest A MA</strong>
</span></li><li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Export on the aquired Forest B MA</strong>
</span></li><li><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;"><strong>Confirming Import on the Forest B MA</strong>
</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">the new and existing mail contacts were either updated or created as Cross-Forest Mail Contacts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;segoe ui&#39;;">Once the correct attribute flows were configured on the Forest B MA, the users in Forest B were able to grant the ability to share calendars with users in Forest A</span></p>
