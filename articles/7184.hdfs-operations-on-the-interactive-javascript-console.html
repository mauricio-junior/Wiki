<h2><a name="Shell_Commands"></a>Shell Commands</h2>
<p>The web console supports execution of HDFS commands via the Javascript function “fs”. For example, you can run:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode">fs(<span class="str">&quot;ls&quot;</span>)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This function exposes the same set of file system commands that is available from running “hadoop fs” on the command prompt. Because file system operations are so common, there is a shortcut available – the following is equivalent to above:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode">#ls</pre>
</blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode"> </pre>
<h2><a name="Uploading_Files"></a>Uploading Files</h2>
<p>You can upload a file to HDFS by running:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode">fs.put()</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A dialog will pop up which will allow you to select a file from your local file system, and optionally specify the destination HDFS directory.</p>
<p>This is intended to be used to upload JARs and scripts to the HDFS, and possibly sample input data no more than a few megabytes in size. It should not be used to upload Big Data.</p>
<h2><a name="Reading_Files"></a>Reading Files</h2>
<p>You can read a file from the HDFS into the Javascript context as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode">file = fs.read(<span class="str">&quot;/path/to/file&quot;</span>)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Once this command completes, you can store the data into a Javascript variable:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode">data = file.data</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now <em>data</em> is just a regular Javascript string, and holds the contents of the file.</p>
<p>You can also pass an HDFS directory into fs.read(), in which case all the files are in that directory are concatenated together and returned.</p>
<h2><a name="Parsing_Structured_Data"></a>Parsing Structured Data</h2>
<p>If the file you are reading contains structured data, it may be more useful to de-serialize the file into a Javascript array. You can do this by using the
<em>parse</em> function with a <em>schema</em>, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="csharpcode">data = parse(file.data, <span class="str">&quot;name, count:int, expiry:date&quot;</span>)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>schema</em> is a string in the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;column_name&gt;[:&lt;column_type&gt;][, ...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>column_name is any valid Javascript identifier for that column </li><li>column_type is one of
<ul>
<li>date </li><li>int (or long) </li><li>float (or double) </li></ul>
</li><li>If column_type is omitted, or none of the above, it is assumed to be a string.
</li></ul>
<p>The data string should be in the form of tab-separated columns, with one line per row. The parse function will return a Javascript array of objects with the specified column names as properties, containing values with the corresponding data types.</p>
