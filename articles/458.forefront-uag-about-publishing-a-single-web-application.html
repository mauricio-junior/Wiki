<p>Users accessing corporate resources published&nbsp;via Forefront UAG&nbsp;can access&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;applications via a UAG corporate gateway, or&nbsp;can&nbsp;connect directly to a single&nbsp;Web application.</p>
<p>To allow users to access one or more corporate applications&nbsp;via a Web portal, you&nbsp;do&nbsp;the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a trunk that includes a portal home page. </li><li>Add the applications for which you want to allow access to the trunk. </li><li>Users connect to the portal by typing the portal public host name in a browser, and access published applications.
</li></ol>
<p>To allow users to access a Web application directly, you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a trunk that includes a portal home page </li><li>Add a Web applicatiion with an application-specific host name to the trunk. </li><li>Users connect directly to the Web application by typing the application-specific public host name in a browser.&nbsp; When the UAG server receives such a request, it performs authentication, and then automatically opens the required application, bypassing the
 UAG portal home page.&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p>Best practices for publishing Web applications directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have published more than one instance of an application public host name, ensure that the application path for each instance is unique.
</li><li>Ensure that the application-specific host name is resolvable by a public DNS server.
</li><li>In the DNS entry, the application host name should resolve to the same IP address as the public host name of the trunk.
</li><li>In HTTPS trunks, it&#39;s recommended that both the public host name of the trunk and the public host name of the application should be included on the server certificate used by the trunk.&nbsp; Alternatively you can use a wildcard certificate.&nbsp;If you use&nbsp;names
 that do not&nbsp;match the certificate, ignore the certificate warning that pops up during trunk configuration. If names do not match, connecting endpoints will be presented with a browser warning that there might be a problem with the website’s security certificate,
 and must choose to continue for site access. </li><li>The application’s public host name must be in or above the domain-level namespace of the portal’s public host name.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that although this option allows users to access a Web application directly, it does require them to remember a public host name for each application published in this way.
