<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

This was created after another article said it failed to publish with an error - apparently it did publish despite the error message and I cannot delete this article.<br />
<br />
The article is <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20290.small-basic-grammar-basics.aspx">
Small Basic: Grammar Basics</a>.
