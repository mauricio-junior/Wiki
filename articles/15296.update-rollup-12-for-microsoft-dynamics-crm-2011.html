removed&nbsp;shortly after publishing&nbsp;during the same day due to an issue discovered&nbsp;</a>and later

re-released as a new v2 edition on January 29th, 2013</a>. CRM Outlook clients update was released earlier on January 8th. UR12 was scheduled to become available through Microsoft Update on January 22nd, 2013, but only the Outlook, email router and reporting
 extensions files were released, while the server bits remain unavailable. The build number of the original on-premise release was&nbsp;5.0.9690.3218. The v2 files published through Microsoft Update have a newer build number&nbsp;5.0.9690.3233. The distribution of the
 UR12 CRM server component through Microsoft Update is scheduled for&nbsp;<span style="font-family:&#39;Segoe UI&#39;,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:#333333;"><br />
</span><br />
CRM Online update schedule is tied to the roll-out of December 2012 Service Update. Existing CRM Online organizations began receiving the update in the beginning of January 2013. New trial sign-ups will have the update starting from mid-January. It is important
 to note that<em> Update Rollup 12 server bits <strong>do not</strong> deliver the same features as December 2012 Service Update (codename Polaris) for CRM Online</em>. The new features, such as the new &quot;flow UI&quot;, Bing Maps &amp; Skype integration, iPad Safari
 client, Activity Feeds update and Yammer integration, will not be available for on-premises environments until the next release (codename Orion) expected to arrive in Q2 2013.<br />
