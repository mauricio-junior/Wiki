 technology or live instances. Whether on-premises or hosted, deploying SharePoint Server requires the IT pro to be heavily involved. Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010<span style="font-size:12px;">
</span>includes a large number of improvements to features that the administrator is familiar with, and it also includes many new features.<br />
<br />
Specifically, SharePoint Server 2010 provides the IT pro with:<br />

<ul style="margin-top:0in;list-style-type:disc;">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><strong>IT pro productivity </strong>
by improving the administrative experience and by giving the administrator deeper operational insight. This increase in productivity is facilitated by a new, streamlined Central Administration Web site, new capabilities to manage and monitor the SharePoint
 farm, and <span style="font-size:12px;">Windows </span>PowerShell<span style="font-size:12px;">™</span> support, just to name a few features.
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><strong>Scalable unified infrastructure</strong> that includes better control over server resources (for example, to improve the performance and management of large lists) and data management and protection
 by using high availability. We have also introduced a new scalable services architecture that allows you to effectively manage and centralize services like Search, My Sites, and Taxonomy. These service applications can be managed through Central Administration,
 and they can be managed and scripted by<span style="font-size:12px;"> using Windows</span> PowerShell as well. The new services architecture is extensible, so third-party companies can build services and add them to the platform.
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><strong>Flexible deployment </strong>
by providing a quick and simple installation and configuration process. The upgrade from Office SharePoint Server 2007 is smooth and predictable. We’ve also introduced functionality that allows you to manage how your users use SharePoint. For example, you can
 now safely allow site administrators to upload custom user code by using Sandboxed Solutions. You also have more governance control: If you want to maintain a centralized SharePoint deployment versus a more decentralized approach, you can either block those
 deployments through Group Policy or track them by using Active Directory<span style="font-size:12px;">®</span> marker support.

<div>SharePoint Server 2010 provides a very large number of features, and a detailed accounting of each feature is well beyond the scope of this document. This guide will describe some of the most compelling improvements and new additions to
 the SharePoint Server 2010 platform for IT pros. With this evaluation guide, the IT pro will be able to properly evaluate these new features and readily describe their capabilities to their colleagues, clients, and business partners.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Next, we will briefly discuss a summary of the new features, followed by a brief summary of how these features can be used to achieve functions such as governance and high availability. Then we will move on to the details of each of the
 pertinent features.</div>
