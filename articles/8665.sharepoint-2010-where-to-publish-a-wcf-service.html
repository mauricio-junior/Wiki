If you&#39;re creating a WCF service you basically have two options:<br />
<ol>
<li>Create a WCF service in a SharePoint context. </li><li>Create a separate WCF service. </li></ol>
If you&#39;re creating a WCF service in a SharePoint context, you&#39;re basically doing the following: you create a SharePointproject, add the WCF service and deploy it to the ISAPI folder. See:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff521581.aspx"><span>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff521581.aspx</span></a>&nbsp;for more info. Also, check out &nbsp;<a href="http://cksdev.codeplex.com/"><span>http://cksdev.codeplex.com/</span></a>,
 it contains a helpful WCF template.<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re creating a separate WCF service,&nbsp;&nbsp;you&#39;re basically creating a WCF project and publish the service. See
<a href="http://sharepointdragons.com/2011/10/07/parallel-programming-in-sharepoint-2010-the-back-to-the-future-pattern/">
http://sharepointdragons.com/2011/10/07/parallel-programming-in-sharepoint-2010-the-back-to-the-future-pattern/</a><br />
<br />
So, when it comes to choosing one of the two scenarios, which one is best practice, and why?<br />
<br />
<h2><a name="Create_a_WCF_service_in_a_SharePoint_context"></a></h2>
<h2><a name="Create_a_WCF_service_in_a_SharePoint_context"></a><span>Create a WCF service in a SharePoint context<br />
</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you need the service to run in the current SharePoint context </li><li>If you want to use the Complete support of SharePoint APIs </li><li>If you want your client to access your service with the same experience as of SharePoint OOB services
</li><li>If you extend some custom functionality of your solution which is by default not provided by SharePoint services.
</li><li>If you want to use and provide the same authentication/authorization configured in the farm while accessing your service.
</li><li>&nbsp;If your service is getting used internally between the SharePoint farms. </li><li>&nbsp;If you want to access the custom service internally for your Solution (client / server kind of architecture)
</li></ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><a name="Create_a_separate_WCF_service"></a>Create a separate WCF service</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider to wrap a .NET 3.5 service in a separate WCF 4 service that uses TPL to speed up things (the back to the future pattern
</li><li>If this is just some functionality from your solution which you want to expose to outer world.
</li><li>You can only use the Client APIs / SharePoint webservice / or your custom code reference inside your WCF service.
</li><li>You have to take care of Authentication/autorization </li><li>If can be accessed by some other client, without even knowing the existence of SharePoint in back-end.
</li></ul>
<br />
If you do create a separate WCF service,&nbsp;it&#39;s best practice to run it in a separate (non-SharePoint) IIS web site. This way, you won&#39;t inherit the config settings of the SharePoint web application, which usually makes things a lot easier.<br />
