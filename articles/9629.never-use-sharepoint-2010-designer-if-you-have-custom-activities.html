<p>In my current assignment I wx;" />
When a new event is created, a new document library should be created, then in the event a link to the document library should be updated. After 30 days the document library should be moved to an archive sub-site and the link should be deleted.</p>
<p>I suggested at the beginning that it should be done via a Visual Studio workflow but I was suggested that it should be done with SharePoint Designer so we can use out of the box functionality and do it faster.</p>
<p>Well, I am going to explain why this is not an option, in this particular scenario, SharePoint Designer does not have activities to Create a document library with specific naming logic and it does not have an activity to move the document library from one
 site to another sub-site. SharePoint designer can copy or move files, but it does not allow to loop through folders or library neither.</p>
<p>Sharepoint Designer 2010 is not for developers. Maybe its good for powerusers, but for really experienced developers or consultants, its not an option in scenarios where you need custom activities.</p>
<p><strong style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">The reasons are very simple:</strong><br style="margin:0px;padding:0px;" />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Timing. </li><li>Easy of maintenance. </li><li>Easy deployment. </li></ol>
<p><strong style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">Option 1: SP designer workflow.</strong><br style="margin:0px;padding:0px;" />
</p>
<ol>
<li>You start creating a Sp designer workflow. </li><li>Then you need a custom activity. </li><li>You create the custom activity in visual studio. </li><li>You need to create a feature that deploys the dll to the gac. </li><li>You need to create a feature that adds the authorizedtypes entry into the web.config.
</li><li>You go back to sharepoint designer, you have to close it and open it back to see the custom activity.
</li><li>You finish the workflow. </li><li>Then you need to export it to see it in the assets library. </li><li>Then you can download the WSP. </li><li>Then you need to write a long document in how to deploy all these things in test and production environment.
</li><li>&nbsp;If a change needs to be done, you need to go change the custom activity, and also the sharepoint designer workflow, then export again, update, etc, I am not going to run into details here, but you get my point.
</li></ol>
<p><strong style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">Option 2: Visual studio workflow.</strong><br style="margin:0px;padding:0px;" />
</p>
<ol>
<li>You open visual studio, create one solution with 2 projects, one for custom activities, another for the workflow.
</li><li>You develop all the logic there. </li><li>You create in the same vs solution one feature to add the authorized types into the web.config.
</li><li>There is only one WSP created which will include inside the custom activities dll.
</li><li>Installation can be done in 20% of the time than the other solution. </li><li>Maintenance its a lot easier and faster. Updates as well. </li></ol>
