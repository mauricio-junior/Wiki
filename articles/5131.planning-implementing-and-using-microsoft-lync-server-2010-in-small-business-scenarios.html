Microsoft Lync Server is often considered a &quot;big business&quot; solution because of its&nbsp;various moving parts. But with the advent of Microsoft Lync 2010, the complexity of a Lync-based UC solution is now well within reach of the average information worker in the&nbsp;small-
 to medium-sized business&nbsp;(SMB). Here are some things to consider.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="What_are_some_of_the_requirements_and_considerations_for_a_Lync_implementation_in_the_SMB"></a><strong>What are some considerations for a Lync implementation in the SMB?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete solution must be affordable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>Cost&nbsp;often&nbsp;trumps high availability and redundancy </li><li>Solution must be simple for ongoing maintenance </li><li>Solution should have as few systems as possible: Lync doing PBX features </li><li>Solution should support user supplied mobile devices, such as iPhone, iPad, Android, and Windows Phone.
</li><li>Planners do not want to&nbsp;read 100-page planning documents </li></ul>

<h3><a name="Sizing_the_physical_hardware_and_bandwidth"></a><strong>Sizing the Physical Hardware</strong></h3>
<h5></h5>
<p>Since&nbsp;all Microsoft Lync sizing&nbsp;documentation is directed at solutions handling thousands of users many in the SMB space ask: What&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;are the&nbsp;RAM/CPU requirements&nbsp;for a relatively small&nbsp;SMB sized Lync solution? The answer has two parts:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In&nbsp;real-world scenarios SMB&#39;s are&nbsp;finding they can operate with less than the minimums mentioned by Microsoft as reflected by the experiences shared in comments on this blog post. (<a href="http://windowspbx.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-small-server-will-microsoft-lync.html" title="How Little RAM/CPU for Lync in SMB?" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0066dd;">click
 here</span></a>) </li><li>But to remain in a supported scenario you will want to observe Microsoft minimums
</li></ul>
Having noted that it is important to remain in a supported configuration,&nbsp;you can also note if&nbsp;you are using virtualization you can always test what RAM and CPU you need and be creative in allocating RAM/CPU cores as needed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="Bandwidth_Sizing"></a><strong>How Much Bandwidth Do I Need? Bandwidth Sizing</strong></h3>
<p>Below is a very simple bandwidth calculator. It makes a few assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>That all calls to PSTN cloud are going over PSTN/PRI gateway </li></ul>

Lync Connectivity Outside Your Corporate Network: Edge Considerations</strong></h3>
<p>The Lync Edge server is likely the most complex undertaking in a Lync implementation and because of this it is sometimes avoided. What are some of the needed ingredients to get going?</p>
<ul>
<li>2-4 public, routable IP addresses </li><li>1 public certificate that is issues by a Microsoft&nbsp;approved public CA that supports subject alternative name
</li><li>The Lync Edge Server will need two network interface cards<sup>2</sup> </li><li>You will need access to your public DNS provider to add several A and SRV records.
</li></ul>
<p>Minimum of 2 IP addresses</p>
<ul>
<li>1 for Web Services. (meeting, dialin, lyncwebservices) </li><li>1 for Access Edge, Web Conference Edge, and A/V Edge. </li></ul>
<p>Recommended 4 IP Addresses</p>
<ul>
<li>1 for Web Services. (meeting, dialin, lyncwebservices) </li><li>1 for Access Edge </li><li>1 for Web Conference Edge </li><li>1 A/V Edge </li></ul>
<p>You will also need a public Certificate that is supported by Microsoft Lync. Yes, you can go cheap and get yourself a lot of headache, but just get a Lync supported Cert. TechNet notes that t<span>he certificate must be issued by an approved public CA that
 supports subject alternative name.</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929395/en-us" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for the approved certificate partner list.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="PSTN_PRI_SIP_Trunk_Considerations"></a><strong>Connecting to the PSTN &quot;Cloud&quot;: Trunk Considerations</strong></h3>
<p>There are several ways you can connect Microsoft Lync to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network" title="PSTN" target="_blank">
Public Switched Telephone Network</a>&nbsp;so you can dial good old telephone numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSTN (aka POTS lines) </li><li>PRI </li><li>SIP Trunking </li></ul>
<p>Due to the inflexible nature of PSTN you will likely select PRI or SIP trunking as preferred for a live environment.<br />
Auto Attenant,Subscriber Access and Conferencing will require DID&#39;s. You may select whether users need DID&#39;s for extensions.<br />

<a name="Microsoft_Lync_for_Small_Business_FAQ"></a>
<h3><a name="Microsoft_Lync_for_Small_Business_FAQ"></a><strong>Microsoft Lync&nbsp;for Small Business FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. Can I install Lync Server on or in a Microsoft Small Business Server environment?
<br />
<strong>A</strong>. The answer to both of these questions is no<sup>3</sup>. First of all Lync Server is not supported running on a Domain Controller. Second, Microsoft Small Business Server Active Directory schema is currently not a Microsoft supported scenario
 with&nbsp;Lync Server. (<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ocsplanningdeployment/thread/61fa156e-e1fc-4437-9083-ab26f2b75f53/" target="_blank">more info</a>)<br />
<br />
<strong>Q</strong>. Can I install Lync Server on Exchange Server? (collocate Lync and Exchange on same Operating System)<br />
<strong>A</strong>. No, this is not supported and their will technical difficulties as well. (<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ocsplanningdeployment/thread/e3d1effd-2af4-4ccc-9f34-2498e1a52abb/" target="_blank">more info</a>)<br />
<br />
<strong>Q</strong>. Should an IT generalist attempt to plan and&nbsp;implement Microsoft Lync Server?<br />
<strong>A</strong>. Lync requires competency in almost every area possible: AD, Exchange, WANs and routing, Certificates, telecom&nbsp;and&nbsp;VOIP. Since an IT generalist implementing Lync is basically &quot;learning on a live system&quot; it will likely be a &quot;rough&quot; experience
 for users. Getting an experienced partner to assist with&nbsp;planning and implementation&nbsp;and the IT generalist taking over day to day administration would be advisable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q</strong>. Do we need to have a Microsoft Lync Edge Server?<br />
<strong>A</strong>. This is a very common question for SMB because there is an attempt to keep the solution as simple as possible. The answer to the question is: No, you do not NEED an Edge server IF you only want Lync functionality inside your firewall. Having
 said that my belief is that ultimately most organizations will want to deploy an Edge. Below are some of the benefits of an Edge server and what you will loose&nbsp;without it:</p>
<ul>
<li>No ability to do web meetings with people outside your network </li><li>No ability to do Federation with partner organizations (<a href="http://bit.ly/lyncfed" title="Lync Federation Project article" target="_blank">more info</a>)
</li><li>No ability to do PIC federation with Live Messenger, AIM and Yahoo </li><li>No ability to have needed push notifications on Lync Mobile&nbsp;for iPhone, iPad and WindowsPhone devices
</li><li>No ability to have Lync laptop users outside your firewall<sup>1</sup> </li></ul>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. Can all the servers needed for a small Lync implementation run on one Hyper-V server?<br />
<strong>A</strong>. Yes, Hyper-V is actually the&nbsp;ideal solution&nbsp;for a small Lync implementation. A Hyper-V server with sufficient RAM/CPU can easily handle all the servers required the SMB size of 50-150 users.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q.</strong> Does purchasing Office365 E4&nbsp;also provide&nbsp;Lync Server Licensing?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> My understanding is the Office365 provides user CAL&#39;s, but no server licensing. Here are my sources:

<strong>Q.</strong> What are some commonly asked for features in SMB that are not in Microsoft Lync?<br />
<strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;Below is a list of some items that are sometimes asked for in SMB. I would suggest&nbsp;<a href="http://windowspbx.blogspot.com/2012/04/trying-to-drive-fast-instead-of-fly.html" title="Driving or Flying? UC Centric Solutions blog article" target="_blank">considering
 a UC centric alternative</a> to some of these as a solution. Example: intercom users might now use IM instead; music on hold from external source can now be supplied from an audio file; and buddy dialing can be done from Lync client instead of deskphone. Moving
 from traditional PBX to UC centric solution will involved some change of mindset to realize the benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call Pickup (pickup another ringing phone)<sup>4</sup> </li><li>Call Booking (if all trunks/CO lines&nbsp;are busy, user can subscribe to get a notice when one is free to use)
</li><li>Intercom (2 way peer to peer call where the remote endpoint automatically picks up)
</li><li>Shared Line Appearance/ Key System Functionality&nbsp;(more details <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/node/48342">

</li><li>1 Button &quot;buddy&quot; deskphone dialing (available via 3rd party Lync Qualified&nbsp;deskphone like
