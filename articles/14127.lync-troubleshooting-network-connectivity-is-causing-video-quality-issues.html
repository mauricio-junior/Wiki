<h1><a name="Symptoms"></a>Symptoms</h1>
<p>Poor network quality can affect the video quality. </p>
<h1><a name="Resolution"></a>Resolution</h1>
<p>Check the following to improve network quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend that you do not show video over a wireless internet connection, virtual private network (VPN), or remote access service (RAS) connections.
</li><li>If bandwidth is a problem for you, limit other computer activities while showing a video.
</li><li>Home networks typically have less upload bandwidth available than download bandwidth. Disabling the video feed that you transmit to others can increase the overall quality and experience of your call.
</li><li>Stop other unnecessary audio or video. </li><li>Check whether other computers on the network are using a lot of resources or performing heavy downloads or uploads, and see if they can be delayed or halted.
</li></ul>
