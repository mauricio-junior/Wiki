<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/5503.surface.aspx">Microsoft Surface
</a>introduces a new relationship between people and technology, one that unfolds intuitively through the natural input of human touch. This relationship appears in space and form by paying attention to design.
</p>
<p>To design compelling Surface 1.0 experiences, you should think differently about the user interface (UI) than you do when you create traditional graphical user interface (GUI) products or Web experiences. If you are accustomed to working in the mouse-based
 world of GUI applications, you must consider many issues when you create applications for a multitouch system like Surface. For example, because Surface is a multiuser system, each user should be able to act independently yet simultaneously, so you cannot
 just enable users to click a tool that applies to all contacts on a Microsoft Surface unit.
</p>
<p>These guidelines can help you develop and design high-quality applications and user experiences that make the most of multitouch interaction principles. The
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff318689(v=surface.10).aspx">2 Interaction Design Guidelines</a> section describes the core principles for optimal user-interaction paradigms in multitouch applications developed for Surface and provides basic
 guidelines for when and how to use those principles. The other sections provide the principles for visual and textual design together with practical guidelines for implementing them.
</p>
<p>These guidelines represent what the Surface team has learned over the last several years and are not exact specifications of Microsoft Surface applications. Instead, the guidelines include approaches to design great Surface experiences so that you can create
 applications that demonstrate the Surface promise of a natural user experience.</p>
<h1 class="title"><a name="Touch_and_Multitouch"></a>Touch and Multitouch</h1>

<div id="sectionSection0" class="section">
<p>The primary mode of user interaction with Microsoft Surface is “natural” and “intuitive” touch. A good Surface application stimulates people’s interest and offers a fun, engaging experience without intimidating them. Whether the application is a game, one
 that involves a task (such as ordering food from a menu or making a reservation or ordering tickets), or just a playful or entertaining experience (such as the Water attract application or Photos application), the users’ hands go immediately to the Surface
 screen and they just “know” what to do.</p>
<p>Interacting with Surface is as simple as touching. Users gain confidence and gradually try more interactions, from one finger to multiple fingers. Microsoft Surface is a multitouch platform that users can approach and use from any side. While you can create
 more traditional applications that orient to one side, Surface offers the unique feature of a 360-degree user interface without any fixed top, bottom, left, or right.</p>
<p>Multitouch also means that multiple people can use a Surface unit at the same time. Microsoft Surface can also respond to physical objects placed on it and offers a significant opportunity to facilitate social interaction among users.</p>

<p>Users can use their entire hand to interact with Surface. It can sense and respond to large contacts.</p>

<p>Users can use gestures to interact with Surface. They can brush or move their fingers or hands across the screen and see that it responds to more than just a stationary touch. Microsoft Surface facilitates a social experience after a second or third person
 joins in.</p>

<p>Microsoft Surface responds to objects. In the default Water attract application, when someone places an object on the screen, water ripples will bounce off the object.</p>

<p>Keep these key points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li class="unordered">Microsoft Surface can recognize and respond to more than 50 discrete simultaneous contacts.<br />
<br />
</li><li class="unordered">You can design a Surface application for one person or for multiple people to use simultaneously. (In many cases, the same application can do both.)<br />
<br />
</li><li class="unordered">A Surface application can have a top and bottom, but it can also have a 360-degree orientation so that users can approach the unit and use the application from any side.<br />
<br />
</li><li class="unordered">Surface applications that have a 360-degree orientation demonstrate the maximum potential of a multiuser experience.

<p>Let’s clarify the Mestures</h2>
<div id="sectionSection0" class="section">
<p>Microsoft Surface recognizes and responds to one kind of touch, which is called a
<em>manipulation</em>, a <em>gesture</em>, or a <em>manipulation gesture</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>manipulation gesture</em> occurs when a user puts a finger (or object) on a virtual object and changes that virtual object while the finger or the object retains its position relative to the virtual object.</p>
<p>For example, if the Surface screen displays a photo of three people standing next to each other and you touch the head of the person in the middle and slide your finger to right, the photo will move to the right, and the middle person’s head will stay under
 your finger. Or, if you touch one finger to the upper-right corner of the photo and another finger to the bottom-left corner and then slide your fingers in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the photo will rotate and your fingers will stay in
 the same places on the photo.</p>
<p>In traditional applications, a <em>system gesture</em> is one in which the system recognizes a contact and runs a command that is based on that contact. A system gesture causes changes to the system state without a change in the visual representation under
 a user’s finger or object. For example, a user could trace a question mark with their finger to open Help. Or, a user could put a physical object on the screen and cause virtual objects to scatter—this is a change in system state even though it has an associated
 visual change. There are <em>no</em> examples of system gestures in the Microsoft Surface platform today.</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface recognizes three discrete manipulation gestures:</p>
<ul>
<li class="unordered">Move<br />
<br />
</li><li class="unordered">Rotate<br />
<br />
</li><li class="unordered">Resize<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
</div>
<h2 class="heading"><a name="Movements"></a>Movements</h2>
<div id="sectionSection1" class="section">
<p>The Microsoft Surface SDK describes only three manipulation gestures. However, from a design and user-interaction perspective, users can make many different movements with those three manipulation gestures, which opens a world of interactive design possibilities.</p>
<p>The following table shows a variety of movements that a user can use on a virtual object with one finger and multiple fingers (using one or both hands).</p>

<p>Microsoft Surface can respond to physical objects. There are two types of objects: tagged and untagged.</p>
<ul>
<li class="unordered">A <em>tagged object</em> is a physical object that has a special tag with a pattern of dots affixed to it that Surface sees in infrared. Microsoft Surface reads the tag and performs the actions that are programmed for that tag. For example,
 an application in a restaurant or bar could use a tag on the bottom of a glass so that when a customer puts the glass on the screen, bubbles appear around the bottom of the glass. In another example, a tag can be used to display a menu or other information
 when a user places an object on the screen. <br />
<br />
</li><li class="unordered">An <em>untagged object</em> is any physical object without the special Surface tags. The Surface unit sees the object as a ”blob” (that is, the system knows an item is touching it, but it does not know its precise shape). You can use the
 Surface SDK to recognize untagged objects.<br />
