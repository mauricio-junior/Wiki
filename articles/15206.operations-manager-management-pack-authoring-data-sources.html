<p>Monitors and rules are the primary elements of a health model and provide similar yet distinct functionality. Monitors set the state of a monitored object, whereas rules create simple alerts and collect data for analysis and reporting. Each monitor and rule
 is defined by the source of the data that was used to perform its required functionality and the logic to evaluate this data.</p>

Although they provide different functionality, monitors and rules use a common set of sources that provide the data to evaluate. For example, a monitor may use a performance counter to set the state of a particular object. A rule may access the same performance
 counter in order to store its value for analysis and reporting. The following sections provide the details of each different kind of data sources that may be used in monitors and rules.<br />

<strong>Note:</strong><br />
The data sources and monitoring logic discussed in this section are those that can be created by using wizards in the Authoring console. Other data sources and logic can be implemented by creating custom modules and workflows as discussed in the
