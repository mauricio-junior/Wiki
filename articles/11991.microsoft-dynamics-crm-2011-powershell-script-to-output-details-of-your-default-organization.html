<p>Windows PowerShell enables you to easily run deployment commands without writing code using the Deployment Web service. To execute commands, you must first configure Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 with Windows PowerShell.</p>
<p>My blog describes a small script to output details of your Default Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Organization.</p>
<p><strong>The script is verified on the following Windows platforms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server 2008 R2 </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server 2008 </li></ul>
<p>This is a PowerShell script. You can copy this script into a text editor and save the file as a PowerShell file. PowerShell file has an extension of ps1. I have saved this script as ‘DefaultCRMOrganization.ps1′.</p>
<p>You can save this PowerShell file ‘DefaultCRMOrganization.ps1′ to your server. Microsoft Dynamics CRM administrators and professionals can have a quick browse through the details for their default organization by simply running this file.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><a name="The_Script_File_lsquo_DefaultCRMOrganization_ps1_prime"></a><strong><span style="color:#ff00ff;">The Script (File ‘DefaultCRMOrganization.ps1′)</span><br />

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes when you run this file, for the first time, it might open in Notepad. In order to open this file with a PowerShell application, associate this file (with extension ps1) with C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</p>
