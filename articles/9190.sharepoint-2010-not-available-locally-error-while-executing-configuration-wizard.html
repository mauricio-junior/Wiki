<br />
<br />
This was failing just at the step where the &nbsp;connection to existing configuration database is carried out. The logged in user had all necessary rights including them in admin and content database. After some initial investigation I though of starting the wizard
 as an administrator option by right clicking on it and selecting &quot;<strong>Run As Administrator</strong>&quot;. We did it and thats it it worked.<br />
