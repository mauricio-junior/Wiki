<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cloud &#43; Enterprise Division here at Microsoft is building a worldwide community of IT pros who want to share their frank opinions about our products (primarily Windows Server, Microsoft System Center, Windows Azure, and SQL Server). We call it the
<strong>International Customer Advisory Board (ICAB)</strong>. <br />
<br />
In the ICAB, we discuss Microsoft technology, troubleshoot technical issues,&nbsp;and weigh in on innovations in content and community—on two private, invitation-only online groups (Connect and Facebook). Members may also be invited to exclusive events at conferences
 like MMS, Tech Ed, and the MVP Summit. <br />
<br />
</p>
<h2><a name="What_rsquo_s_in_it_for_you"></a>What’s in it for you? </h2>
<p>In addition to networking and troubleshooting, you’ve got Microsoft’s ear—and a whole new community of colleagues across the globe, which can be helpful when you decide to chuck it all and move to Paris or Hong Kong. What&#39;s in it for Microsoft, of course,
 is having a group of smart, dedicated people tell us what they really think. You&#39;ll be offering us a glimpse into what our customers want from our products, helping us make better products for you.
