<p>This may be due to an issue with Proxied Internet access.&nbsp; If you are not using a proxy config for the DST but instead bypassing this you need to ensure that access to the following URL&#39;s is allowed from the system running the DST.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/v3/static/trustedr/en/">http://www.download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/v3/static/trustedr/en/</a>*<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/pki/mscorp/">http://www.microsoft.com/pki/mscorp/</a>*</p>
<p>This is due to some CRL checking that takes place for the SSL/TLS underlying connection.&nbsp; If those URL&#39;s cannot be reached the TLS connection will not succeed.</p>
