<h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
<br />
<br />
There are various layers and groups of communication within Microsoft, MSDN and TechNet, however none of them bring the community layers together.<br />
<br />
The TechNet &amp; MSDN Skype Chat Group is a Skype Group frequented by&nbsp;MVPs, MCCs, MS bloggers and other notable members of the MS community.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is no agenda, other than the exchange of MS community related chat and news.<br />
<br />
<h1><a name="What_it_offers"></a>What it offers</h1>
<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re a blogger, you may find this a great source for news and gossip.<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re an MVP or MCC, this&nbsp;a the place you can better serve the community and contribute advice.<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re active in the MS community and want to help more, this is the best place to start.<br />
<br />
<h1><a name="What_it_doesn_t_offer"></a>What it doesn&#39;t offer</h1>
<br />
<br />
Technical/product support - You may find someone who is knowledgeable to help, but this is not an official MS support channel in any way.
<br />
Nobody is obliged to help you or pass a message upstream.<br />
<br />
Contacts - People can be added by any other group member, or only have to share their Skype contact details with
<a href="mailto:NoReplyMsChat@hotmail,com">NoReplyMsChat@hotmail,com</a> <br />
By being added to the group you will not get everyone else&#39;s contact details, they will show as always offline.
<br />
Do not expect other members to accept your contact request.<br />
<br />
<h1><a name="How_to_join"></a>How to join</h1>
<br />
<br />
If you know someone already in the group, they can simply drag your name (from their contacts list)&nbsp;into the group.<br />
<br />
If you do not know anyone already in the group, simply send a contact request to &quot;<a href="mailto:NoReplyMsChat@hotmail,com"><span>NoReplyMsChat@hotmail,com</span></a>&quot; This is a &quot;no reply&quot; type contact which is monitored by various
 people. Someone will check for contact requests every few days (usually a week at the most) and add any new names to the group.<br />
