1. After installation of above software you will find a new OLEDB connection inside connection manager of SSIS . i.e. &quot;Oracle Provider for OLEDB&quot;.<br />
<br />
Remark : This OLEDB is a 32 bit version so you cannot run package by BIDS until you make &quot;Run64BitRuntime&quot; in project property to &quot;false&quot;.<br />
<br />
2. Test connection by inserting credentials and if it does not work then there is some issue with tnsnames.ora file . Please verify if you have placed it in right place and if the credentials are correct .<br />
