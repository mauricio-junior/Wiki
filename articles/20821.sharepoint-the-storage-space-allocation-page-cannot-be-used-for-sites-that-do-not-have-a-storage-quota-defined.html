<p><strong>Issue:</strong> User was getting error message below while accessing the Storage Space Allocation page:</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#0070c0;">The storage space allocation page cannot be used for sites that do not have a storage quota defined.<br />
</span></em><br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/4024.Storman.jpeg"><img alt=" " src="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/4024.Storman.jpeg" width="479" height="138" style="border:0px solid;" /></a><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><br />
Background:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">While doing some regular clean-up of the sites which are over quota, I noticed that site is not having the Site Storage Allocation page in the Site collection administration page, which was quite strange though.
<br />
</span><span style="color:#000000;">Accessing storage page directly via _layouts/storman.aspx page, shoes the above error message.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Troubleshooting:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Checked the same behaviour on the other site as well and it was not the same.
<br />
</span><span style="color:#000000;">Tried to activate and deactivate the Office Publishing feature. Storage Allocation link was still not appearing.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Resolution:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Checking the site storage quota we have noticed a much wired thing is that the site was given quota or you can say it was set to be 0 MB with Warning level of 0 MB.
<br />
</span><span style="color:#000000;">Not sure that was done, seeming like a human error obvious.
<br />
</span><span style="color:#000000;">Set the correct quota for the site and Site Storage Allocation page was back.
<br />
