<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

<p>As you implement search functionality for a particular search services provider (SSP) in a Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 farm, you can configure index servers and query servers in one of the following two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a single computer in the farm as the index server and the query server. For this configuration, you must enable both the index server role and the query server role on one computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use one computer in the farm as the index server (but not as a query server) for the SSP, and use one or more other computers in the farm as query servers (but not as index servers). For this kind of configuration, you must enable the index server role (but
 not the query server role) on one computer in the farm, and you must enable the query server role (but not the index server role) on one or more other computers in the farm.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The following procedure explains how to enable or disable the index server role or query server role on a server in an Office SharePoint Server 2007 farm.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You must be a shared services administrator and a member of the Administrators group on the server that you are configuring.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Central Administration, on the <strong>Operations</strong> tab, in the <strong>
Topology and Services</strong> section, click <strong>Services on server</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the Services on Server page:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the server name that appears is not the server that you want to configure, click the arrow next to the server name, click
<strong>Change Server</strong>, and then click the server for which you want to enable or disable the index server role or query server role.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Start services in the table below</strong> section, in the <strong>
Status</strong> column for <strong>Office SharePoint Server Search</strong>, if the status is
<strong>Stopped</strong>, in the <strong>Action</strong> column click <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Office SharePoint Server Search</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
</li><li>
<p>On the Configure Office SharePoint Server Search Service Settings page, in the
<strong>Query and Indexing</strong> section, enable server roles for the server as appropriate for your configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To enable the index server role on the computer, select <strong>Use this server for indexing content</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To enable the query server role on the computer, select <strong>Use this server for serving search queries</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>To save changes and return to the Services on Server page, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
