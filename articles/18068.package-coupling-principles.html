Package Cohesion principles</a>, the Package Coupling principles determine the inter-relationship between the packages that are mostly used. The rules that govern the inter-relationship between packages comes under Package Coupling Principles.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>1. The Acyclic Dependencies Principle</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;The dependencies between packages must not form cycles&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />

Package Cohesion principlesfocus manpower. Generally people work in groups when working on a single package and later on when the release is made, all the packages are merged to the main module. &nbsp;Sometimes, Engineers tend to refer
 to another package for common resources. When a package is dependent on a package and the package is in turn dependent on the same package again, it is called cyclic dependencies. In other words, say Package &nbsp;A is dependent on B, and B is somehow dependent
 on A again, then it is said there exists a cyclic dependencies between A and B.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>2. The Stable Dependencies Principle</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;Depend in the direction of stability&quot;<br />
<br />
Stability is defined as the amount of changes to be made to a software package when a change is made to the dependent package. The notion of the principle is to support on dependencies in the direction of stability.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>3. &nbsp;The Stable Abstractions Principle</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;Stable packages should be abstract packages&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A package is said to be stable when any release to the other packages does not modify it. When there is a situation when all the packages pointing to the stable package, the stable package need to be abstract.&nbsp;
