<p>If you are finding that no federated search results are displayed in searches, or you see a
<strong>Location not found</strong> error message, a server proxy setting is most likely stopping search&nbsp;from reaching&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote location for crawling or federation. You can specify proxy server settings for crawling content and querying federated sources on
 computers in other networks, such as the Internet. In many cases it is necessary to use a proxy server to bypass intranet security restrictions.</p>
