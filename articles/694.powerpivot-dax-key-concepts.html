    <li><i>Operators</i> within expressions, such as a plus or minus sign, indicate how the values are to be compared or processed. </li>
    <li><i>Values</i> that you use in formulas and expressions can be typed directly into the formula bar as part of an expression, or they can be obtained from other columns, tables, or formulas. However, you cannot reference only a few cells or a range of cells; DAX always works with complete columns or tables. </li>
