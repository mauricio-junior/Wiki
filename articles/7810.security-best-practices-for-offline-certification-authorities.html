<p>Offline Certification Authorities are divided into two types depending on the PKI hierarchy tier you are building. In a 3 tier PKI hierarchy you should have at least 2 Offline CAs , defined as an&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articlesment-bottom"><div class="r1 fiji-r1"></div><div class="r2 fiji-r2"></div><div class="r3 fiji-r3"></div><div class="r4 fiji-r4"></div></div></div></di/2900.offline-root-certification-authority-ca.aspx" title="Offline Root CA page" target="_blank">offline
 root CA</a> and an offline&nbsp;policy CA. In a 2 tier hierarchy, you will only have a single offline CA, which is the offline root CA. The security practices discussed in this article&nbsp;apply to all offline CAs.</p>
<h1><a name="Private_Key_Protection"></a>Private Key Protection</h1>
<ol>
<li>It is recommended to use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to protect the Private Key of the CA.&nbsp;&nbsp;HSMs can either be network attached through a private network to the CA, commonly used in virtualized offline CAs, or can be directly attached to the CA.
</li><li>Never connect a CA to the network to reduce any attack footprint on the CAâ€™s&nbsp;operating system (OS)&nbsp;or private key
</li><li>Establish a chain of custody and key signing ceremony whether you are using an HSM or not
</li></ol>
<h1><a name="Physical_and_Logical_Access_to_the_Offline_CAs"></a>Physical and Logical Access to the Offline CAs</h1>
<ol>
<li>Access to the CAs should be limited only to the CA Administrator of the PKI hierarchy
</li><li>It is recommended to disable remote access technologies to the CAs such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
</li><li>Offline CAs should be stored in a secure location with an established chain of custody to retrieve the CA
</li><li>Disable CD-ROM auto play, and USB ports either in the BIOS or in the virtual machine settings
</li><li>Keep the CA offline unless you are performing maintenance tasks such as issuing a new CRL, or issuing a new certificate for a subordinate CAli&gt;
</li></ol>
<h1><a name="Auditing"></a>Auditing</h1>
<ol>
<li>CA retrieval should be documented and audited, generally referred to, as a chain of custody, or key signing ceremony
</li><li>The CAs should logically be enabled for auditing, which should be done in two locations:
<ul>
<li>The Auditing tab on the CA properties , where all settings should be enabled and then restarting the Certification Authority services after making the change
</li><li>Object Access Auditing at the operating system has to be enabled. </li></ul>
</li></ol>
