<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

<p>The easiest way for&nbsp;group owner&nbsp;to approve new group members is to use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff512688(v=WS.10).aspx">
FIM Outlook Add-in</a>. But installing and configuring the add-in can introduce many problems. Probably the most common problem is that Approve / Reject buttons are not visible in Outlook. While there are number of things that can be misconfigured, even&nbsp;correctly
 configured FIM and Outlook Add-in are not enough.</p>
<h2 style="color:#365f91;font-weight:bold;"><a name="Symptoms"></a>Symptoms</h2>
<p>When receiving group joining approval emails the Approve / Reject buttons don&#39;t appear in Outlook.<br />
<br />
After making sure, the basic configuration is correct as described in <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/762.aspx">
Troubleshooting the FIM Group Management Outlook 2007 Add-In</a>, still isn&#39;t isn&#39;t solved.</p>
<h2 style="color:#365f91;font-weight:bold;"><a name="Cause"></a>Cause</h2>
<p>FIM Outlook add-in tries to <strong>resolve</strong> the sender against address book(s). Only if that succeeds, it compares the senders address using MAPI property PR_SMTP_ADDRESS (0x39fe) and compares THAT with what is in the settings or registry. Sadly,
 the trace file will not tell you if the comparison failed or the address simply didn&#39;t resolve.
</p>
<p>This is how the code sees the valid message from resolved FIM Service account:</p>
<pre>Address              = /o=EDS/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=FIMService
AddressEntryUserType = olExchangeUserAddressEntry
Name                 = FIMService

Resolved Sender      = FIMService@acme.com
Valid Sender         = FIMService@acme.com</pre>
<p>And this is how it sees the message if FIM Service is not in the GAL / is not resolvable.</p>
<pre>Address              = FIMService@acme.com 
AddressEntryUserType = olSmtpAddressEntry
Name                 = FIMService@acme.com

Valid Sender         = FIMService@acme.com 
Resolved Sender      = 
</pre>
<p>So, the comparison of last two lines will fail, although the sender actually is correct, has correct email address but it isn&#39;t recognized as Exchange User Address entry.</p>
<h2 style="color:#365f91;font-weight:bold;"><a name="Resolution"></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>Make sure that FIM Service account is in user&#39;s GAL and that the email alias will resolve in Outlook.</p>
<p>I case with more than one domain when users in each domain see their own subset of the GAL one possible solution is adding &quot;All Users&quot; to last place in &quot;When sending mail, check names using these address lists in the following order&quot; list in Outlook configuration.</p>
