<h2><a name="Problem_Statement"></a>Problem Statement</h2>
In this issue, we were exporting a new user object to Active Directory using an Active Directory Management Agent.&nbsp; We were provisioning to Microsoft Exchange 2007.&nbsp; During this export process, we started receiving several Event ID 6801 errors in the Application
 Event Log.&nbsp; The error will contain information like stated below in the error message.&nbsp; In receiving the error message, we would see the Active Directory User Object get created with some of the Microsoft Exchange Attributes populated.&nbsp; However, the Microsoft
 Exchange Mailbox is not created.<br />
<br />
This is an indication that there is a problem with the Update-Recipient Exchange PowerShell CMDLET.<br />
