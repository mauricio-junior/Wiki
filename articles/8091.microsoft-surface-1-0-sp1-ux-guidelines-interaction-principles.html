<h1><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<em>Interaction design</em> defines the interplay of the software with users&rsquo; behaviors, responses, and gestures. Interaction design principles help enhance the user experience by making it easier for people to learn, immerse themselves in, and enjoy the software experience. While these principles align closely with purely visual graphic design, audio design, and textual design, interaction design provides an all-encompassing perspective about how easily and naturally users interact with technology.
<p>Microsoft Surface is a major development in the area of Natural User Interface (NUI). It is more similar to sophisticated video games that create immersive universes than it is to traditional task-driven and analysis-driven productivity software. Microsoft Surface adds the crucial component of directly manipulating fingers and objects on a large screen that can accommodate multiple users simultaneously. While Microsoft Surface applications can have a discrete top and bottom orientation, applications that have a 360-degree orientation demonstrate the maximum potential of a multiuser experience.</p>
<p>This article describe the theory behind the interaction design principles and provide actionable guidelines for implementing those principles when you create Microsoft Surface applications.</p>

<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>This section gives high-level descriptions of the eight user-interaction design principles behind the development of successful Microsoft Surface applications. These principles are interconnected; the amount of emphasis you place on any of them depends on the type of application you are creating. For example, an application that a hotel uses to help people locate points of interest and plan a walking tour should be responsive and visually engaging, but it is primarily a tool for gathering information. A more playful application, such as the Microsoft Surface Photos application, places more emphasis on creating engaging interactions and delighting the user. If you understand the nuances of all the principles and how they complement each other, you will be able to create more effective and engaging applications.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a name="Seamless"></a>1. Seamless</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody"><a id="bkmk_Seamless"></a>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>Seamless experiences require users to immerse themselves in the application mentally and emotionally so that they commit to new experiences without hesitation. You create seamless experiences by suspending users&rsquo; sense of disbelief. <em>Suspension of disbelief</em> refers to a person&#39;s willingness to accept something as true or sufficiently real even if it is fantastic or impossible in the real world. An application can help users suspend their disbelief by creating a self-contained, immersive world that simulates a living, breathing environment.</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface applications should help users suspend their disbelief by mimicking real-world objects and using virtual-world capabilities to enhance the user experience what is possible in the real world. Imagine a Surface application that initially displays a globe that you can spin by flicking it with your finger. You can also touch a location on the globe to zoom in closer. Each touch zooms in closer until you see points of interest that you can touch to create a personalized itinerary.</p>
<p>Successful suspension of disbelief requires the seamless combination of the physical and virtual worlds through the flawless performance of the technology behind the experience. A Surface application must respond continuously to fingers and objects that are placed on the screen and must immerse users in a better-than-life experience. For example, if a user places a cocktail glass on a Surface screen in a lounge, the user interface should create a visual response to the glass and display the name and ingredients of the cocktail (if the glass has a drink-specific byte tag or identity tag).</p>
<h2 class="title"><a name="Social"></a>2. Social</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody"><a id="bkmk_Social"></a>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>The input and output methods of standard GUI applications explicitly create social barriers. That is, those experiences are designed for just one person with one mouse, one keyboard, and no touch screen. In contrast, Microsoft Surface accepts input from multiple users simultaneously, so several people can gather around one Surface unit and play the same instance of a game or manipulate different photos at the same time. Microsoft Surface can elevate activities from a solitary experience to a social experience.</p>
<p>The social experience extends beyond the interactions between people and the Surface interface. Interactions between users and the Surface unit are natural, intuitive, and unobtrusive, stimulating more communication among the people gathered around the unit. People focus more on each other than on the computer, so the computer becomes secondary to the social experience.</p>
<p>You can use cooperative techniques from video game design principles in Surface experiences to make engaging, fun, and social applications. When you conceive and design Surface applications for multiple users, consider how users might manipulate objects and complete tasks simultaneously and how you can present the experience to users on all sides of the unit.<br />

Interactions between users and the Surface unit are natural, intuitive, and unobtrusive, stimulating more communication among the people gathered around the unit. People focus more on each other than on the computer, so the computer becomes secondary to the sodiv class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>Traditional GUI interaction models are flat, planar, and two-dimensional (2-D). You can use some <em>two-and-a-half dimensional</em> (2.5-D) techniques, such as skewing planes, adding shadows, and overlapping elements, to give depth to some objects. However, Microsoft Surface interaction models go beyond a single plane to provide depth, encourage immersion, and make objects appear to have volume or take on real-world, three-dimensional (3-D) characteristics so people can navigate in all dimensions.</p>
<p>However, not all applications benefit from 3-D environments. Sometimes 3-D environments can disorient and confuse users, but your application&#39;s behaviors, transitions, and navigation should nevertheless consider the z-axis. For example, photos and videos in the Photos application rest on a flat canvas, but they rise to the surface when users touch them to give the environment a feeling of depth and realism.</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface applications represent objects volumetrically and rely on users&rsquo; depth perception and spatial memory. Environments can extend off the screen, and users can drag the environment around to relocate content. Objects can be stacked in 3-D space by using depth to sort, distribute, or focus on content. As long as users can use gestures to navigate the environment and orient themselves, they can create a mental model of the space, its content, and the gestures that they can use to access that content. Users naturally develop associations between what they want to do (for example, play a game) and where they do it (for example, in a game application) from memory-triggered context.</p>
<h2 class="title"><a name="Super-realism"></a>4. Super-realism</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody"><a id="bkmk_superrealism"></a>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>Because touch is physical, it gives users a sense of direct interaction with, and control of, technology. You can create more fluid, natural experiences by mimicking real-world physical interactions and enhancing them beyond what is possible in the real world. <em>Super-realism</em> pushes beyond what is physically natural so that applications do more than what is possible in the real world. In this way, super-realism is natural and direct, but not literal.</p>
<p>For example, a user might use a Microsoft Surface application to touch a photo and push it around, just like in the real world.</p>
<img title="Gestures - Dragging object from stack" id="f3ab9c80-39b3-49a9-be90-e4403b60d077" alt="Gestures - Dragging object from stack" src="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC373495.jpg" />
<p>However, <em>unlike</em> the real world, the Surface application enables the user to scale the photo by using a two-finger gesture.</p>
<img title="Gestures - Resizing object" id="f06d60f3-3e86-45a3-810a-5af6cce85616" alt="Gestures - Resizing object" src="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC373496.jpg" />
<p>The objects in a Surface application have a &ldquo;better than real&rdquo; quality that mimics the physical nature of real-world objects. Every time a finger, hand, or object interacts with a Surface application, the unit responds to make the experience feel &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and natural. To design such an experience, you should make objects and interactions act beyond what is possible in the real world. Super-realistic objects with super-realistic capabilities give people a sense of control that other methods of interaction cannot provide.</p>
<p>To create natural interactions, create the base of the interactions in the real world and then extend them in an intuitive manner. To create super-realistic interactions, enhance the virtual objects in their digital environments to exceed the limitations of their real-world equivalents.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<h2 class="title"><a name="Contextual_Environments"></a>5. Contextual Environments</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody">
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>Microsoft Surface applications respond to the people and objects that touch them and react based on the context of internal and external environments (what people are doing based on their behaviors and where they are in the overall experience). In the video game industry, this reaction is known as <em>causality</em>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface applications should respond to people&rsquo;s actions in a way that clearly relates to their context and behaviors so that they can see the correlation between their actions and the Surface unit&rsquo;s responses. These correlations help users learn to anticipate and control the consequences of any action. Without these reactions, the experience feels random and users do not know how to make changes in the environment. <br />

<h2 class="title"><a name="Scaffolding"></a>6. Scaffolding</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody"><a id="bkmk_Scaffolding"></a>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>The Microsoft Surface experience should offer fewer choices instead of superfluous features and should create one simple but rich, fun, and rewarding solution. For example, there might be only one method to print photos, but it might involve literally placing photos onto a visual representation of a printer.</p>
<p>To help users discover a solution through a rich and pleasurable journey, use <em>scaffolding</em> when you design Surface applications. Scaffolding is a teaching method that approaches bigger challenges (such as &ldquo;How does this whole system work?&rdquo;) by focusing on smaller problem-solving challenges (such as &ldquo;How do I initiate this one action?&rdquo;) through the use of prompts, hints, and leading questions. Scaffolding provides supportive structures and moments that encourage users to explore. You can use scaffolding to structure Surface applications by dividing tasks into small, self-evident steps to maximize the visual or emotional reward and to simplify moment-to-moment decision-making.</p>
<p>As part of scaffolding, present users with a minimal number of choices for a given decision to avoid confusion. By offering fewer choices, the experience is more enjoyable because of easier decision-making and the gradual disclosure of information or required choices over time.</p>
<p>Simplicity does not necessarily mean simplistic. Simple processes and tasks can be rich and powerful. Microsoft Surface experiences should demonstrate robust results that do not require complex procedures.<br />

<h2 class="title"><a name="Performance_Aesthetics"></a>7. Performance Aesthetics</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody">
<p class="section">Video games such as Myst&reg; and its sequel, Riven&reg;, motivate users to explore the beauty of the game&#39;s world. Microsoft Surface applications should also be visually beautiful, but they must also include the aesthetic of performance. Because of the physical nature of touch, gesture, and direct manipulation, a Surface application must include seamlessness between objects that touch the Surface screen and the information that appears on it. An application must not experience performance lags or hiccups that interrupt the visual fidelity, frame rate, or acoustic fidelity. Microsoft Surface applications should be flawless, responsive, and immediate to make the experience feel accurate, smooth, and natural.</p>
<p class="section">The combination of beauty <em>and</em> performance aesthetics in Surface applications enables users to engage in multisensory interactions that create emotionally engaging experiences. These emotionally engaging experiences enable users to imagine, discover, and experiment with the world and establish important social boundaries, relationships, and rules.</p>
<p class="section">To create visual beauty and performance aesthetics in Surface applications, your application must appeal to users&#39; senses:</p>
<div class="section">
<ul>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Sight</em> and <em>sound</em>. Create highly crafted visual representations of content, motion, and sound.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Imagination</em>. Enable users to discover new places, things, or effects and then stimulate their imagination with visually compelling cues.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Challenge</em>. Include challenges, but not daunting problems, for users to solve as they find solutions to the visual cues to inspire a sense of satisfaction.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Pacing</em>. Enable users to complete well-paced decision-making. Each user should have a set of rules, a context, and a goal, and then each user can find the most effective way to reach the goal.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li class="unordered"><em>Immersion</em>. Create experiences that deeply engage users so that they enjoy escaping to this environment and exploring its systems, rules, and space.</li>

<h2 class="title"><a name="Direct_Manipulation"></a>8. Direct Manipulation</h2>
<div id="mainSection">
<div id="mainBody">
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>A Microsoft Surface unit responds to touch and direct manipulation, whether by one finger, many fingers, or objects. For example, users can explore a music library by flipping through album covers, or play a chess game by using physical game pieces. Users can seamlessly and intuitively manipulate content in real-time. </p>
