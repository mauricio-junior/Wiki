this blog</a> by Ed Price about joining the team of people responsible for featured articles selection process.<br />

If we want to nominate <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/wikininjas/archive/2013/06/11/technet-guru-awards-may-2013.aspx">
May 2013 Guru contributions winners</a>&nbsp;to be featured on the first page, then my question is - how many articles can be featured at once?<br />
<br />
How about - first week - all 1st places articles<br />
Next week - all second place artiels<br />
Third week - all third place articles<br />
Following week - all other articles that were competing.<br />
<br />
What do you think about this idea?<br />
