<div class="post-content user-defined-markup">

<p>I get asked about this every once in a while so I thought I would post it here in case itâ€™s something you might find helpful as well.&nbsp; This report will contain the last login time on a particular computer along with the user who logged in to it as well as
 some additional details.</p>
<p>To create the report follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Edit the SMS_DEF.mof file to enable the following class: </p>
<p><strong>Network Login Profile</strong></p>
<p>Also enable the sub class: </p>
<p><strong>LastLogon </strong></p>
<p>2. Create a report with the below query:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span style="color:midnightblue;"><strong>Select <br />
V_GS_SYSTEM.Name0 as [ComputerName], <br />
V_GS_NETWORK_LOGIN_PROFILE.TimeStamp as [Last Login Time], <br />
V_GS_NETWORK_LOGIN_PROFILE.Name0 as [Logon User], <br />
V_GS_SYSTEM.Domain0 as [Logon Domain], <br />
V_GS_SYSTEM.SystemRole0 as [System Role], <br />
V_GS_SYSTEM.SystemType0 as [System Type] <br />
from V_GS_NETWORK_LOGIN_PROFILE <br />
left JOIN v_GS_SYSTEM ON V_GS_NETWORK_LOGIN_PROFILE.ResourceID = <br />
v_GS_SYSTEM.ResourceID <br />
where V_GS_NETWORK_LOGIN_PROFILE.LastLogon0 is not NULL</strong></span></p>
