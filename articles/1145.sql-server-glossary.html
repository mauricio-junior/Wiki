<td>relationship</td>
<td>
<p><a name="relationship"></a>1. A link between tables that references the primary key in one table to a foreign key in another table. The relationship line is represented in a database diagram by a solid line if referential integrity between the tables is
 enforced, or a dashed line if referential integrity is not enforced for INSERT and UPDATE transactions. The endpoints of a relationship line show a primary key symbol to denote a primary key-to-foreign key relationship, or they show an infinity symbol to denote
 the foreign key side of a one-to-many relationship. 2. In Metadata Services, a relationship is an associstination. The association repeats for each subsequent pair of
 objects, so that the destination of one relationship becomes the origin in the next relationship. In this way, all objects in an information model are associated through a chain of relationships that extend from one object to the next throughout the information
 model.</p>
