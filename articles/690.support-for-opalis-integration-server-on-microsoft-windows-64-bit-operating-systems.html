<div style="color:#000000;font-size:small;">Opalis Integration Server is not supported on any 64-bit edition of Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; Opalis Integration Server may successfully function under a 64-bit environment, however this has not been thoroughly tested and
 may result in unexpected errors and/or poor application performance.</div>
<h3 class="ms-SIfield"><a name="More_Information"></a>More Information</h3>
<div style="color:#000000;font-size:small;">
<p>Using x64 hardware does not necessarily require that a 64-bit Operating System be installed. Because the x64 architecture is an extension of the x86 architecture, all x86-based Operating Systems will install and run natively as a 32-bit Operating System
 and as such is considered a supported state. </p>
<p>Using IA-64 hardware is not supported at all as this hardware is a completely different architecture that does not run 32-bit Operating Systems.</p>
