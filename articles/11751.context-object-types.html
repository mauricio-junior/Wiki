<p>Any add-in that is invoked by the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) console is executed in a separate application domain from the console. There is no direct communication from an add-in to the VMM console. However, the console will provide lightweight context
 objects that provide supply information about what was selected in the console when the add-in was invoked. These context objects will uniquely identify a console object and let you use this information to programmatically work with VMM tside the console, such as calling a Windows PowerShell cmdlet.</p>

<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<p>The add-in API provides a base class for all context objects that could be passed from the console, to the add-in, which is the
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ContextObject</span> base class. This class contains two properties,
<strong>Id</strong>, a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">GUID</span> type that identifies the console object, and
<strong>Name</strong>, a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">String</span> type that has the name of the object. Depending on the actual derived class the
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Microsoft.SystemCenter.VirtualMachineManager.UIAddIns.ContextTypes.ContextObject</span> is, it may contain more properties that provide more, although basic, information about the object.</p>
<p>A user may select one or more items in the console, and if your add-in is invoked, a list of context objects will be passed to your add-in. The list of context objects passed to your add-in will always be of
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ContextObject</span> type. Since the manifest of your add-in can be configured to display your add-in button or view on different types of objects, you will have to determine which derived class your context objects are
 actually.</p>
