<p>As Microsoft our closing blogs and moving platforms, we have decided to save some of our favourites in this archive.</p>
<p>These are the footprints of our lives and a historical chapter in community collaboration.</p>
<p>These blogs narrate the unfolding of technology and have helpful code snippets, or detailed descriptions.</p>
<p>This is an archive of Microsoft blogs which have been saved for future generations.</p>
<p>The project is an unofficial copy of content that has been taken offline.</p>
<p>The content is taken unchanged, fully credited to the author, and is a collaboration between Microsoft MVPs and TechNet/MSDN/Docs teams of Microsoft.</p>
